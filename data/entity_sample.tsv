device	I have never played eiDEVICEr.
device	that is so wild lol, they need an DEVICE system for the deterrent, but I am sure it will get hacked in that case
device	You have never used a DEVICE?
duration	Me too, I can't imagine a DURATION so short.
duration	Everyone must have been in complete panic for that DURATION.
duration	ThDURATIONt's DURATION convincing enough reDURATIONson for me to never pursue running DURATIONt thDURATIONt level.
duration	I know there are a ton because it's been going on for DURATION.
duration	Yeah over like DURATION.
duration	Right DURATION in and i have to start all over, lol!
duration	Well they played non stop for DURATION almost, so there is a chance
duration	thats over a DURATION years ago.
duration	I don't know what to think, but i sure hope something gets done over then next DURATION.
duration	I got into the wrong line of work I guess, that seems like a lot of money to make for someone who hasn't played in like DURATION.
event	Oh my goodness I could not imagine that happening last EVENT.
event	Yeah I usually only watch during EVENT.
event	It is, did you watch the EVENT?
event	I agree, but I wonder about the EVENT-offs this year.

location	i live in LOCATION so its always on
location	I bet not, I am excited to see if we get to LOCATION.
location	I guess, but why LOCATION?

location	I bet it has something to do with LOCATION!
location	I did not know that about LOCATION.
location	Ones from LOCATION?
location	Maybe somewhere in LOCATION you have a fashion twin
location	Yes I have been to LOCATION!
number	Yeah I would like to hear his opinion on Belt's NUMBER pitch at bat
number	Yeah that was a bad business decision, could have made NUMBER now for millions then
number	Yep, only NUMBER which is crazy.
number	NUMBER would go a long way, I cant even imagine.
number	Its called the Blair house, its so big since its composed of NUMBER seperate buldings.
number	Yea and multiple that by NUMBER people, that makes for a lot
number	I have heard that but shouldn't the number be NUMBER, then?
number	NUMBER?
number	Oh, which NUMBER versions?
number	I can't imagine being able to create that at NUMBER!
organization	Wow, I wonder what ORGANIZATION reasoning is for that?
organization	Or order it from ORGANIZATION...
organization	I believe it, although you have to wonder how much of that is actually ORGANIZATION?
organization	I used to love playing ORGANIZATION.
organization	I see, I guess ORGANIZATION has the financial power to do that and more, I used to own a pair, they were really comfortable.
organization	It's become so easy to shop on ORGANIZATION with 1 click shopping.
organization	It is crazy to think about all of the characters that have made it through the ORGANIZATION.
organization	More than likely it was ORGANIZATION, they were pretty big at that time.
organization	for sure, I am glad they just stuck with ORGANIZATION and not the whole name lol.
organization	you have ORGANIZATION though?
party	It's surprising though that throughout history the PARTY has held the majority.
party	It's just difficult to believe it was actuallu PARTY party.
party	I think it is the PARTY that are at fault.
party	Yeah, the PARTY was a lot different more recently than people think.
party	I completely agree with that and same is probably true for PARTY.
party	They are biased and pro PARTY.
party	I consider myself a PARTY but its good to have several points of view
party	I don't know, PARTY?
party	Yeah, my bet is Hillary cleaned out their finds and then went PARTY.
party	I agree, just not the support needed to elect an PARTY.
person	I have many... Maybe PERSON... You?
person	I have been to both, but I did not know that PERSON band christmas trees
person	Same kind of thing with PERSON.
person	I would think PERSON is, right?
person	Did you read PERSON's Game ?
person	Watching PERSON might have been fun.
person	PERSON patented his though.
person	PERSON must have discovered a way to live without sleeping.
person	I don't know PERSON.
person	Probably, except for the deep lean that PERSON was famous for.
position	Yeah, not sure but probably makes the POSITION seem less far reaching and more people friendly.
position	Well I think we both have a decent knowledge of POSITION.
position	Do you know much about the POSITION?
position	I that that was where the POSITION lived.
position	the POSITION was the runner up right?
position	Yes, I heard the obscure rule that was invoked by a POSITION.
position	I love when POSITION do things like that!
position	That is suprising, I would guess most former POSITION had one,
position	lol Do you know who the wealthiest POSITION were?
position	lol, I think I could be POSITION before getting a model.
softwareapplication	yeah, i haven't used SOFTWAREAPPLICATION in the longest time
softwareapplication	I do like SOFTWAREAPPLICATION a lot.
softwareapplication	I think that SOFTWAREAPPLICATION was smart for turning them down.
softwareapplication	i admit,  SOFTWAREAPPLICATION is awesome as well.
softwareapplication	I would love to see that, I wonder if I can watch that on SOFTWAREAPPLICATION, and I wonder how they know that
softwareapplication	I rent from SOFTWAREAPPLICATION all the time.
softwareapplication	yea that wasn't a smart move, do people even use SOFTWAREAPPLICATION anymore?
softwareapplication	I do watch SOFTWAREAPPLICATION a lot.
softwareapplication	Yes, and now SOFTWAREAPPLICATION is a thing of the past.
softwareapplication	Oh yea,  on a daily basis,  love SOFTWAREAPPLICATION.
