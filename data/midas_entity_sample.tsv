opinion event	I heard of that, and think it's ironic because of the colors from the EVENT.
opinion event	I'm EVENT same way.
opinion event	I would have to say EVENT.
opinion event	EVENT last year was pretty good.
opinion event	I agree, can you imagine the EVENT between both teams?
opinion event	Maybe that is the secret to be a five time EVENT winner!
opinion event	I watch some, I am excited for the EVENT, you?
opinion gamename	Yeah I used to love playing GAMENAME growing up!
opinion gamename	I still remember how people were crazed about GAMENAME
opinion gamename	I love GAMENAME.

opinion location	That's a cool fact to know if I'm ever in LOCATION.
opinion location	I liked LOCATION.
opinion location	Sounds kind of racist, don't think it would fly in LOCATION.
opinion location	I had hear that, I love the name they gave to the 'LOCATION'.
opinion location	I know right,  just thinking about LOCATION and everything out there is very humbling.
opinion location	Yeah, that would be LOCATION.
opinion location	I would prefer if they put their heads together and help LOCATION.
opinion location	There would probably be a lot of arguing in the LOCATION if you had two opposing sides trying to make decisions all the time...
opinion location	Haha I want to live in LOCATION now!
opinion location	I wonder too, I heard maybe in LOCATION they still are.
opinion number	Interesting, I liked the original NUMBER, all the others were pretty bad in my opinion.
opinion number	I agree 100NUMBER!
opinion number	No, but i will ride in one that goes NUMBERmph haha
opinion number	Yeah same here, and I guess it's NUMBER per!
opinion number	"Im not much taller, only NUMBER"", jumping really hasnt been my strong suit."
opinion number	That seems to me to be about NUMBER too many.
opinion number	NUMBER times better.
opinion number	NUMBER feet is FAR!
opinion number	Not sure I want to go NUMBER mph in a yellow bus and a cranky Dutch man at the wheel.
opinion number	Exactly yet they get paid NUMBER.

opinion organization	ORGANIZATION is amazing.
opinion organization	I am not such a big fan, but at least I know what ORGANIZATION Stands for.
opinion organization	ORGANIZATION is good too.
opinion organization	Yes I really like ORGANIZATION too.
opinion organization	I think it's funny that ORGANIZATION trademarked the names super hero and super villain.
opinion organization	Good for ORGANIZATION!
opinion organization	ORGANIZATION is a good choice.
opinion party	Yeah, the PARTY was a lot different more recently than people think.
opinion party	I agree, just not the support needed to elect an PARTY.
opinion party	That they are a PARTY based?
opinion party	I don't know, PARTY?
opinion party	Just another PARTY I don't want to be around, haha!
opinion party	They are biased and pro PARTY.
opinion party	Yes, or PARTY.
opinion party	I consider myself a PARTY but its good to have several points of view
opinion party	The PARTY use to be very different.
opinion party	I got to be honest the older i get and as far as what they stand for i'm leaning more and more PARTY.
opinion person	I wonder if PERSON is still kicking himself lol.
opinion person	I love PERSON.
opinion person	Wow, hey, if I found some worth that much I might be able to bid on PERSON's mansion!
opinion person	Small people tend to be great dancers, PERSON wasn't too tall either I don't think
opinion person	I like to see PERSON in an era appropriate language and accent.
opinion person	I haven't, honestly, but that's a cool little fact as I didn't know PERSON ever did that.
opinion person	The French explorer PERSON.
opinion person	Thats really funny, PERSON just kills me, his the best lol
opinion person	 I cannot say that I agree with PERSON on that one.
opinion person	For sure, PERSON was on fire at that time lol.
opinion position	Also, POSITION are less educated than I thought.
opinion position	Maybe a better POSITION could change that.
opinion position	Where the runner up became POSITION?
opinion position	Maybe we do, those are called POSITION too.
opinion position	I loved that in the past someone from the other party was your POSITION.
opinion position	i think they should bring the runner up is the POSITION
opinion position	I think being a POSITION would be very stressful.
opinion position	We're lucky that we don't use the system where the runner up became the POSITION anymore.
opinion position	I love when POSITION do things like that!
opinion position	ya I don't mind it, sad though a POSITION has to work at target just to get by
opinion softwareapplication	I think so,  SOFTWAREAPPLICATION does.
opinion softwareapplication	Ok, great chat about SOFTWAREAPPLICATION, it's been fun, have to great night.
opinion softwareapplication	Oh yea,  on a daily basis,  love SOFTWAREAPPLICATION.
opinion softwareapplication	I will look up SOFTWAREAPPLICATION, not a gamer but best to be aware.

opinion softwareapplication	That was a straight loss for SOFTWAREAPPLICATION.
opinion softwareapplication	Holy crap, yeah that sounds like the peak hours or the SOFTWAREAPPLICATION and chill hours if you will lol.
opinion softwareapplication	I think just the plan to destroy SOFTWAREAPPLICATION, but very funny.
opinion softwareapplication	SOFTWAREAPPLICATION is the way to go.

opinion sport	I do like SPORT.
opinion sport	Well, SPORT has gotten too political with the kneeling, etc.
opinion sport	Yea, i wonder if they do fantasy drafts for SPORT?
opinion sport	I meant to say female SPORT professional players, even.
opinion sport	Interesting, both are really cool But SPORT is better, I guess they couldn't decide!
opinion sport	Oh then yes, although I do like the other SPORT too.
opinion sport	Well, Ive enjoyed chatting with you about SPORT!
opinion sportrole	I was thinking SPORTROLE as well and that's probably about it.
opinion sportrole	Yes certainly I could see a female SPORTROLE.
opinion sportrole	I love SPORTROLE's.
opinion sportrole	The SPORTROLE?
opinion sportrole	I wonder who their SPORTROLE was.
opinion sportrole	So, I guess most SPORTROLE are right handed.
opinion sportrole	A lot of SPORTROLE are actually really smart and well educated.
opinion sportrole	I guess the rhythm could be different, the choices of the SPORTROLE would be unexpected.
opinion sportrole	That's a good question because I have also noticed that most SPORTROLE's are white.
opinion sportrole	I think they're both good individually, but they have a kind of partnership that allows them to understand each other and work seamlessly together, possibly much better than other coaches and SPORTROLE.
opinion sportteam	I am right there with you, but a SPORTTEAM fan.
opinion sportteam	SPORTTEAM was terrible.
opinion sportteam	Right that SPORTTEAM loss is brutal!!
opinion sportteam	I would do that for SPORTTEAM haha.

opinion vehicle	Yeah, the VEHICLE are a better way to go there.
opinion vehicle	Yeah, I guess you're not supposed to read on a VEHICLE.
opinion vehicle	i thought the VEHICLE would have gotten faster though.
opinion vehicle	Thats an advantage maybe they also have a VEHICLE that travels at a high speed like the Dutch
opinion vehicle	You could take the bullet VEHICLE, that goes really fast.
opinion vehicle	the VEHICLE hop?
opinion videoname	"It was called ""VIDEONAME"" which sounds kind of interesting."
opinion videoname	I am not a fan of VIDEONAME but I like all the other actors on the show.
opinion videoname	Like something out of VIDEONAME?
opinion videoname	Well, I like VIDEONAME still!

opinion wear	I believe so too, I mean it's just WEAR?
opinion wear	TWEAR would be a similar motion.
opinion wear	Ok, I'll lower my expectations about the WEAR.
opinion wear	Never really cared for WEAR.
opinion wear	I am a weirdo so I would never let anyone wear my WEAR before me.
opinion wear	The WEAR look pretty delicate.
opinion wear	I liked the WEAR myself, still do.
opinion wear	Probably best to stick with the WEAR.
opinion wear	Yeah, I get the same reaction when I wear my WEAR out in public.

opinion year	YEAR Model T...I don't think I would have been part of the mass.
opinion year	that is right, but that was back in YEAR.
opinion year	I don't even know how to measure that either but YEAR is both unbelievable and impressive haha.
opinion year	It was easy to see everyone in the YEAR.
