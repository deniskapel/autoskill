  "i bet he is.",
  "yes i did see that one.",
  "LOCATION, please.",
  "no, i can ’ t let you have it for 12.how about 14?",

  "guess where we ended up.",
  "yeah.  also.",
  "very interesting!",
  "i thus far have stayed away from PRODUCT.",
  "wow i would like to learn more about that.",

  "it's been nice talking with you.",
  "i'm sorry i couldn't help you.",

  "how tall is she?",
  "i think i heard about that before.",
  "he was probably really thrifty about them.",
  "no, he left nothing.",
  "that's when i watch it.",
  "apparently it's because they can actually play in the PRODUCT if need be.",
  "i like it very much, but it's a little confusing to me.",
  "yeah i wouldnt mind that.",
  "what did you think of LOCATION?",
  "that's all there is.",
  "that's a great visual - and i guess probably true!",
  "have you ever visited FAC?",

  "that would work out great!",
  "as the LOCATION is called.",
  "well its interesting because even though he is amazing and was the 2015 OCCUPATION.",

  "yep - me too.",
  "if you are into sci-fi.",
  "yeah, that's what i thought.",

  "i bet they are kicking themselves now.",
  "that is indeed true.",
  "apparently not.",
  "i liked watching the other SPORT_TEAM better.",
  "ya it was horrible.",
  "okay, is there anything else?",
  "i am surprised at that.",
  "not sure if its possible.",
  "how about the LOCATION?",
  "i'd like to see the SPORT_TEAM win.",
  "that's pretty harsh.",
  "it's dry because there's no FOOD to it.",
  "i'm sorry we won't.",
  "i dont think i do either.",
  "you've seen it before?",
  "so common.",
  "i wonder why they aren't?",
  "doesn't sound like it fair well.",
  "they definitely did!",
  "alright, then please put it in a PRODUCT and take it outside.",
  "if you could just talk to him, i would greatly appreciate it.",
  "we'll have to make sure to come back here again real soon.",

  "i find them very interesting.",
  "i did know that and to me.",
  "isn't that interesting.",
  "they are two PRODUCT.",
  "then, you should dress well.",
  "i think it is to psyche them out.",
  "they definitely have.",
  "that definitely must anger him to know.",
  "i'd like to study in the uk, but it's really expensive.",
  "pokemon go?",
  "is it dry yet?",
  "that true.",
  "ya i should too.",
  "its been good talking to you as well.",
  "i'll come to that.",
  "yes and they understand poininting.",
  "i didn't know he was from LOCATION to be honest.",
  "this isn't like you...",
  "oh got it.",
  "i guess it's just a common NORP.",
  "i haven't heard of him.",
  "where will we sleep, then?",
  "not very much.",
  "they still send PRODUCT.",
  "i didnt either.",
  "i mean the BUSINESS is very innovative and interesting.",

  "yeah and i wonder if any of them have ever played.",
  "that's really crazy.",
  "i already tried that.",
  "how do you plan to accomplish this?",
  "i think it's ok.",
  "i think that's funny as well.",
  "so you want to go to LOCATION?",
  "teddy roosevelt!",
  "i bet that is why he was so good at martial TYPE_OF_SPORT.",
  "i never have either.",
  "what do you think?",

  "it's very sturdy.",
  "it's facinating though and amazing.",
  "could you tell her PERSON called?",

  "i can't agree on that.",
  "that is good of them.",
  "yes, they are very fashionable, you see.",
  "i do not know that actually.",
  "where are you going to live after you're married?",

  "let's look at them all.",
  "i thought i was remembering that correctly.",
  "actually, could i have some FOOD with that?",

  "so, why haven't you visited me?",
  "i'm moving to LOCATION ;) lol.",
  "always nice to see a SPORT_TEAM improve.",
  "do you ever go to the FAC?",
  "you are always so hospitable.",
  "they are good.",
  "probably different from today's.",
  "how would they know though they you have smoked.",
  "do you get angry easily?",
  "then that came in handy.",
  "have you ever watched TYPE_OF_SPORT.",
  "no... not really.",
  "you think it ’ s better that he should be told?",
  "technically.",
  "indeed LOCATION is very nice!",
  "i recently read about the SPORT_TEAM.",
  "probably good everywhere.",
  "even the whole LOCATION belonged to him.",
  "it's going to be an interesting SPORTS_EVENT.",
  "i wonder why they do too.",
  "but it's really exciting.",
  "i hear it got cancelled.",
  "it was great talking with you too!",
  "it doesn't sound that interesting to me.",
  "if you really want me to, then i'll do it.",
  "mrs.PERSON.",
  "that one would have sounded weird i bet.",
  "yeah that would have been funny to see.",
  "that's because it's full.",
  "i know not to far from LOCATION 51.",
  "nice to speak to you too.",
  "i would think they would be huge.",
  "so you are very right.",
  "it's true for me i think.",
  "you like swimming too?",
  "well, you can't have everything.",
  "have you got everything?",
  "i'm so happy that you found what you wanted.",
  "nope never seen it but it sounds cool.",
  "yes that is because it was easy to dial in a rotary PRODUCT",
  "oh wow try to google it.",
  "i had heard about that...",
  "speaking of ORG.",
  "i wouldn't carry my PRODUCT up there to check it out.",
  "i am very impressed.",
  "it's a PRODUCT that reads the same forward and backwards.",
  "it sure does help with working on the PRODUCT.",
  "no but i'd love to.",
  "i haven't seen it either.",
  "the WORK_OF_ART itself sound good as well.",
  "well, now you're really going to freak out when i tell you who aced it...",
  "i don't have an BUSINESS any longer.",
  "nope i haven't seen them.",
  "i believe it too.",
  "i guess i didn't know either.",
  "perhaps you should have gotten a FOOD instead!",
  "that i can't tell you.",
  "could you show me how to use the PRODUCT?",
  "i think it will be hard to compare to the BUSINESS.",
  "that's worrisome.",
  "i don't really watch TYPE_OF_SPORT because it's hard for me to follow.",
  "maybe they were just curious as to what it was.",
  "you know how it is when you ’ re in a strange LOCATION.",
  "i just recently learned that as well.",
  "i don't watch him very often.",
  "if you cannot stop it.",
  "ok, we will send some ORG as soon as possible.",
  "very cool and interesting.",
  "i don't either.",
  "that should ’ ve been something you knew already.",
  "that was crazy.",
  "do you have any that you'd recommend?",
  "the PRODUCT came out in 2007.",
  "i wonder why too.",
  "do you think it will help if we appoint a local OCCUPATION?",
  "anyway, i owe you one.",
  "certainly, you're welcome anytime.",
  "nice i want to know how to get to that one.",
  "it's been fun.",
  "what do you think we can do about this?",
  "ah they must be wrong then.",
  "i wonder how much you could realistically retain when you read at that PRODUCT.",
  "i'll be right back.",
  "what ironic to me is.",
  "i will look into it!",
  "oh he was 13.",
  "it will be held at FAC.",
  "sounds very LANGUAGE indeed.",
  "we just might at that.",
  "i believe they did.",
  "who is that by?",
  "that just guts me.",
  "i'm left-handed.",
  "i bet that was funny for sure!",
  "i imagine so.",
  "first of all, you must be punctual.",
  "i should check huh?",
  "no, wait, you will be too cold without PRODUCT.",
  "i enjoy animated WORK_OF_ART.",
  "but if i don't pass, will you call me?",
  "you must enjoy yourself.",
  "can't you see the WORK_OF_ART here?",
  "maybe you're right because i have never seen WORK_OF_ART",
  "i dont think i can.",
  "i still think it's cool that they did that!",
  "i would have thought so too.!",
  "probably somewhat.",
  "that is not surprising!",
  "they would...",
  "ya i did too!",
  "i hope it does.",
  "ha ha nice maybe i should watch it sometime.",
  "thank you.",
  "wow, that much?",
  "do i have to come back here after getting registered?",
  "really!",
  "i'm sure it would be worth it!",
  "do you think it might be PRODUCT?",
  "be interesting that's for sure.",
  "i won't forget.",
  "he is allergic to ANIMAL.",
  "how ignorant i am!",
  "i can ’ t believe she would do that to you.",
  "it's been awhile since i've been to any as well.",
  "right",
  "you may give them to your ORG who come to see you off.",
  "my LAW is pretty similar to yours.",
  "where did you go there.",
  "i wouldnt have guessed that either.",
  "been good talking to you!",
  "he must have been too good!",
  "hambone!",
  "ok, i promise.",
  "cool man.",
  "i think he's got too much on his FOOD.",
  "how WORK_OF_ART.",
  "that is too.",
  "speaking of the ORG.",
  "yes, they're ready to go.",
  "somewhere around there.",
  "oh and i'm sure right now is the best WORK_OF_ART of that.",
  "well it could be.",
  "yeah i guess that is fair enough",
  "that was too bad.",
  "i ’ m mainly interested in learning to play rhythm guitar.",
  "wonderful!",
  "may i open one of these?",
  "sometimes try to skim over it but usually not",
  "but what you should do is study hard.",
  "very close i am sure.",
  "usually.",
  "so what?",
  "well, i didn't think so at first.",
  "the FAC are excellent.",
  "i have heard that it is very popular in LOCATION.",
  "i had heard that too.",
  "it really depends on the PRODUCT.",
  "yeah i would definitely say that it would be MUSIC_GENRE!",
  "he was a good qb i agree.",
  "it sucks.",
  "you are attracted to her.",
  "that would be pretty interesting.",
  "maybe all of us are the same.",
  "yeah i would like to know that too.",
  "they are also another beautiful WORK_OF_ART.",
  "i'm not that knowledgeable of all the OCCUPATION.",
  "ya that is good.",
  "i think i'll have a FOOD.",
  "no, please don't do that.",
  "i am calling to cancel it now.",
  "not i am not surprised.",
  "how long does your LAW remain valid?",
  "can you please slow down?",
  "what would be even more crazy if his MUSIC_GENRE was really really good",
  "i ’ m thinking of taking you back home.",
  "i can't imagine how everyone got so caught up in it",
  "hopeful!",
  "well, thin is always \" in \" with the BUSINESS.",
  "ok.i get it.",
  "yes, i am annoyed by this, too.",
  "do not think so.",
  "i used to listen to ORG.",
  "no, i thought it too dull.",
  "oh, i'm glad to hear that.",
  "it is very quotable.",
  "ok, i ’ m going to stay up awhile.",
  "yeah he has.",
  "i must go to the BUSINESS's.",
  "yeah i thought that was wild too.",
  "sounds illegal.",
  "it does seem late!",
  "i do not think it was bad.",
  "they really are and the LOCATION is definitely beautiful.",
  "that's what's hanging on my mind recently.",
  "it is good to know.",
  "well. think about it.",
  "i am serious.",
  "i hope they do.",
  "i didn't either.",
  "you'll only have to pay for the monthly PRODUCT.",
  "i watch some of them.",
  "i wasnt aware of that actually.",
  "at least he pursued something he loved.",
  "where shall we go?",
  "okay, i guess i'll cook.",
  "i can't imagine ever doing that.",
  "so, it's going to cost me then?",
  "it is okay.",
  "well, when do you think you can come over to work?",
  "you ’ re kidding.",
  "i feel very nervous about it.",
  "ha it would be horrible.",
  "i never knew that.",
  "i have to watch those.",
  "that is kind of funny.",
  "no, i didn't get hurt.",
  "it's a little expensive.",
  "i would have never thought of him doing that",
  "i really like the FOOD.",
  "it doesnt sound right to me either.",
  "and as i recall.",
  "that is very true but PRODUCT are still amazing.",
  "i did not hear about it.",
  "if i remember correctly, it's about $ 130.",
  "i'm nineteen.",
  "that must have been some PRODUCT.",
  "yes, it ’ s essential.",
  "do you take dressing on your FOOD?",
  "i don't think i've ever spent more than $40 on a PRODUCT.",
  "that is totally amazing.",
  "i wonder who their qb was.",
  "again that's totally random.",
  "i am going to go see how much he makes.",
  "i wonder if thats where he draws in WORK_OF_ART from",
  "she is a good WORK_OF_ART.",
  "i'd like to, where?",
  "you ’ re great.",
  "have you?",
  "it isn't that easy.",
  "i just do the PRODUCT",
  "goodbye!",
  "that's possible.",
  "yes he is.",
  "i would not want to either.",
  "i think that is great!",
  "i don't agree with that either.",
  "that won't do.",
  "maybe i should move there.",
  "when do the SPORTS_SEASON start?",
  "that's nice!",
  "that is pretty hilarious.",
  "it must be interesting.",
  "ya just never know when you may step wrong.",
  "well, uh, i'll let you decide that for yourself.",
  "it's rather strange.",
  "that is so odd.",
  "right i agree.",
  "i'm not sure what that means.",
  "how tall are they?",
  "not regularly.",
  "i know my ORG sometimes threaten to punish him.",
  "i heard something about that.",
  "it was a more popular TYPE_OF_SPORT back then so i can see how that worked",
  "oh, i don ’ t. they don ’ t seem to take anything seriously.",
  "ok, thank you very much.",
  "i do use PRODUCT.",
  "oh, forget it then.",
  "ok, i will repeat what i said loudly.",
  "i rarely use it.",
  "probably had someone tell him that.",
  "you know how to play PRODUCT.",
  "but being the ORG.",
  "she was a great TYPE_OF_SPORT.",
  "suppose you have to do one of the two, which do you prefer?",
  "don't worry about that.",
  "anyway, what really matters is that you have tried your best.",
  "i heard that before.",
  "i had heard that recently.",
  "5th ?",
  "i actually didn't know that he or PERSON narrated that.",
  "i don't know if he was.",
  "yeah it was nice talking to you.",
  "i play electric PRODUCT",
  "i think you'll enjoy the FOOD.",
  "i learned it in high LOCATION.",
  "its great talking to you as well.",
  "what LAW did you receive?",
  "yes it does unfortunately.",
  "i don't read through.",
  "i wonder why it didnt do well in the uk and did so well here?",
  "true.. do you know what they are using it for in LOCATION?",
  "that was really preventive!!!",
  "i still have my old.",
  "but mt. everest is at 29.000 feet.",
  "yea i didnt know that!",
  "i wonder if they did.",
  "listen, it's almost dinnertime.",
  "are there small BUSINESS near here as well?",
  "given how much i order from then.",
  "it sounds like a special PRODUCT.",
  "i'm not sure how that works.",
  "he's also excited about PERSON.",
  "what was your PRODUCT about?",
  "i heard of that.",
  "i actually remember hearing that somewhere.",
  "would you like to look at my cousin's PRODUCT?",
  "i would say that all depends on who is using it!",
  "i wonder if they patented it.",
  "i ’ m going to paint it.",
  "that is bad.",
  "i am i guess.",
  "if only we could eat there once more!",
  "hmmm i dont know who they are.",
  "they mimic everything!",
  "that's a good LAW to pass.",
  "i would be curious to know.",
  "i'm not exactly sure.",
  "does it ever!",
  "i bet a few PRODUCT were.",
  "it's not surprising.",
  "i would like to see that too.",
  "i think it is also my favorite.",
  "i'll pretty much listen to anything except MUSIC_GENRE.",
  "yes, it's true.",
  "i had to move it, so that i can get my PRODUCT through.",
  "i do not think they do either.",
  "wow they are so smart.",
  "i will definitely have to check out some of his MUSIC_GENRE then.",
  "yes, apparently four BUSINESS were broken into.",
  "that is insane",
  "a few.",
  "i watch it too.",
  "well personally i liked it.",
  "i've heard of them but never listened.",
  "i ’ m going to make sure and get my EVENT in.",
  "speaking of the x-files, it's on right now!",
  "it says it's located in the LOCATION.",
  "no.  that sounds interesting.",
  "i just read about it.",
  "that's kinda rude.",
  "yeah i can definitely agree.",
  "but i'm not fat enough to enter that EVENT.",
  "i wouldn't know much about that.",
  "yes, i think you'll be very satisfied with that one.",
  "i guess technically.",
  "tell me what you've been doing.",
  "i'm sure only 7% of those 7% actually understand what they're reading.",
  "i have never thought it was interesting .",
  "whoo!",
  "i wonder how that is.",
  "it seems like it.",
  "i guess PERSON must be pretty good at drawing.",
  "that's to funny.",
  "o.k., o.k.let ’ s forget it.",
  "could you elaborate on that?",
  "maybe you needed to own LOCATION.",
  "it's too expensive.",
  "nope it will be a completely different PRODUCT.",
  "same here pretty much.",
  "that sounds really awesome and efficient.",
  "you can come later.",
  "just let me look at it quickly.",
  "i don't know what's worse.",
  "that is hard to believe!",
  "then i might as well have it out now.",
  "well you think if anyone would.",
  "well, he did it anyway.",
  "that seems unnecessary.",
  "it would be nice.",
  "that does not sounds right.",
  "i'm not sure why it's blue.",
  "i know, i am sorry i ever bought it.",
  "i wonder why the ORG did that.",
  "i know...",
  "i think it beautiful.",
  "so was i.",
  "i haven't thought about it.",
  "i usually go on the PRODUCT.",
  "let me help you.",
  "yeah i bet he was very interested in that.",
  "you know what i find interesting?",
  "what are you going to major in?",
  "thats weird.",
  "id seriously have to bundle up.",
  "we are?",
  "don ’ t!",
  "definitely if they're bombing.",
  "i thought it was initially formed by ORG",
  "oh very interesting.",
  "i wonder who the other 11 belong to?",
  "everything is expensive in LOCATION though.",
  "did they catch him?",
  "it's saturday.",
  "i have listened to BUSINESS as well.",
  "i am sure it will be.",
  "i once met PERSON.",
  "i think i might have that too.",
  "i need to get home.",
  "so what do you do there?",
  "besides.",
  "i think so!",
  "well start out from LOCATION this friday.",
  "yeah he apparently did not look like a OCCUPATION enough",
  "what LAW will you receive?",
  "could you please tell me when we get there?",
  "give it a PRODUCT.",
  "the LOCATION is not always greener.",
  "it seems like something he would definitely do.",
  "2000.",
  "it is an PRODUCT that wont get old.",
  "lucky guy!",
  "if they were smart.",
  "you're in one of those in-between LOCATION, aren't you.",
  "have you ever played the PRODUCT?",
  "i am glad we've straightened everything out.",
  "... and maybe that's what we both need.",
  "i'm surprised he hasn't released one.",
  "wow i didnt know that!",
  "yeah that would have been awesome.",
  "now that would have funny!",
  "yeah you can share PRODUCT.",
  "ya i want to see that too.",
  "i just learned that.",
  "some are genuine.",
  "indeed he must have been.",
  "yeah PRODUCT are awesome.",
  "well thinking about the biggest and the baddest.",
  "oh, okay.",
  "sorry, i didn't think it mattered.",
  "i want five PRODUCT.",
  "i used to listen to it when i was younger.",
  "it's more than special.",
  "i have never been there.",
  "yeah i think that is super cool.",
  "apparently she cried when she left.",
  "that sure does!",
  "yeah that's funny to think about.",
  "it would be hilarious.",
  "i think it's the same with an PRODUCT.",
  "i know why.",
  "which was your favorite?",
  "21 OCCUPATION.",
  "probably very few!",
  "i wish they had won.",
  "this coming july.",
  "are we going to see them in june or are they coming to see us?",
  "that will be perfect.",
  "i'm sure we will.",
  "great, let's go.",
  "you think it's funny.",
  "that is pretty shocking.",
  "yeah you would think so.",
  "so, show me the WORK_OF_ART please.",
  "america?",
  "it must have been special.",
  "i have never heard about him .",
  "not all of us did.",
  "oh wow!!",
  "yes thats something i would do too.",
  "while i understand that he did wrong.",
  "and LOCATION.",
  "i need to see that!",
  "that sounds like a PRODUCT.",
  "no i haven't have you?",
  "yes, it's very lightweight.",
  "i wonder what his ORG called him...and i suppose he was pretty 'appeel-ing'....",
  "i don't drink at all.",
  "who?  PERSON?",
  "too bad the us didnt make it.",
  "that's really cool i didn't know that.",
  "as long as the ORG think it is ok.",
  "no i didn't know that that's crazy.",
  "i would have thought they would have to be way thicker than that!",
  "it's surprising that throughout most of the LOCATION.",
  "i don't think i can change it right now.",
  "why do you want to work for our BUSINESS?",
  "i'm not familiar with him.",
  "at least in the BUSINESS.",
  "we would like to begin with a FOOD while we are waiting.",
  "thats funny.",
  "i already tried to call up some of the ORG, but they are all busy.",
  "well, cool.",
  "it's not easy to find.",
  "what does a OCCUPATION do anyway?",
  "can you imagine being that great at anything.",
  "i dont agree with those NORP.",
  "that's smart.",
  "i would love it too.",
  "well it was good talking with you.",
  "yeah he is a good OCCUPATION.",
  "yes, i like it very much.",
  "he really does.",
  "i've heard it somewhere...",
  "it was?",
  "look, i want to succeed just as much as you do.",
  "i will get better soon.",
  "that was sad.",
  "super cool!",
  "ha yes.",
  "do you mind being next to the FAC?",
  "well, how long will it be?",
  "weren ’ t you able to find anything less expensive?",
  "yeah that is really said as we are depended on them tp get our FOOD.",
  "no i didn't!",
  "it's amazing.",
  "i think they are as well.",
  "i do quite frequently.",
  "i have not been to LOCATION.",
  "i see, d.but i plead you to help her.",
  "you don ’ t belong here.",
  "what else will they ask me?",
  "i can as well.",
  "that's all i have to do?",
  "do you know why they did that?",
  "i'll give you something.",
  "that will solve it then.",
  "that was it.",
  "he knows you very well.",
  "i wonder how they would prove that.",
  "i have not read from him.",
  "really?i didn't know that.",
  "yeah i am grateful it's not like that here.",
  "sounds like where i live.",
  "wow i wonder what they do with all that LOCATION.",
  "i told you not to forget to bring the WORK_OF_ART.",
  "i can totally believe that!",
  "it's sad that it's gone.",
  "i guess they must like those two the best.",
  "you know, i could really go for that.",
  "ok.right then.",
  "i dont know the ORG.",
  "it was impressive.",
  "wow i never knew that about PERSON.",
  "i don't think i've watched that!",
  "who voted for him?",
  "yeah i will be waiting to watch it too.",
  "you're all set.",
  "i missed both :) are they good ?",
  "oh wow i did'nt know that.",
  "do you watch anything lately on tv?",
  "that sounds perfect.",
  "oh ok thats good to know.",
  "can you tell me something about your ORG?",
  "ok, i can see that LOCATION.",
  "maybe we will get to hang out some more soon.",
  "we will let you know probably next monday.",
  "ok, ok!",
  "i think more serious.",
  "ok.you can keep it as long as you need.",
  "that could work.",
  "the NATION have spoken.",
  "i was worried about that.",
  "yep i agree with you.",
  "in 2006.",
  "well that's weird.",
  "just for yourself?",
  "oh, listen, i can ’ t even remember.",
  "i mean...",
  "it was great talking to you!",
  "ok.i'll tell her.",
  "that doesn't sound like a good OCCUPATION.",
  "there will be 4 of us.",
  "that is convenient for sure.",
  "go to ORG, please.",
  "you do the same!!",
  "i can remember that as well!",
  "ok i see.",
  "he does?",
  "yeah that sounds really strange to me too.",
  "no i am not.",
  "i like tv.",
  "no, but i am starting working out from now on.",
  "so what are you going to do about it?",
  "yes, i understand.",
  "well, that depends.",
  "large.",
  "that sounds really good to me right now.",
  "i would like to have it done this friday.",
  "actually not really.",
  "oh did not know that one.",
  "that might be true.",
  "he should have had that FAC given to him.",
  "it's illegal here.",
  "i can't say i agree.",
  "it is odd that PERSON broke it.",
  "that will be all.",
  "i've quit it already.",
  "i know i was surprised too!",
  "don't forget to send.",
  "that is so interesting!!",
  "i only recently found out.",
  "LOCATION suffers from what?",
  "yeah that is so nice of him.",
  "yes, i truly do.",
  "i'm terribly sorry i can't go with you.",
  "really thats interesting.",
  "you are very nice to tell me those.",
  "well, let me see...",
  "no, but it will be soon.",
  "i havent heard of that before but who knows maybe there is.",
  "i went all over the LOCATION.",
  "he's been successful.",
  "it ’ s going to cost you $ 25.",
  "is there an additional OCCUPATION?",
  "yes and do you know why they did that?",
  "he is the first WORK_OF_ART really?",
  "i bet you can find them.",
  "or order it from PRODUCT...",
  "do you know his FOOD?",
  "not yet.",
  "ya i think they do deserve more.",
  "it looks like all the smart ORG were.",
  "it is very quiet and peaceful.",
  "but it is too loose.",
  "i won't be staying at the wh.",
  "i used to play.",
  "i know you don't have an FOOD, but you need to eat something.",
  "but i hope WORK_OF_ART don't influence us to be more lazy.",
  "i sure do .",
  "i was thinking that too.",
  "i bet you they are still kicking themselves with it",
  "well i listen to PRODUCT personally.",
  "i don't know much about it",
  "they are trying to get away from the BUSINESS and i think this could come back to hurt them.",
  "maybe they were just attracted to each other but too different to be married.",
  "maybe i should start playing SPORTS_EVENT.",
  "how long should i continue taking them?",
  "too funny!",
  "i heard that to.",
  "LOCATION would beg to differ.",
  "have you voted yet?",
  "i can ’ t say i do.",
  "nope i haven't",
  "i don't really use the PRODUCT.",
  "that's a good one.",
  "seems like i saw that too.",
  "yep that was really nice of BUSINESS's to do that.",
  "i think they need to add some personally.",
  "that does make me sad.",
  "do they charge for that?",
  "that is a good one :)",
  "i know i heard that.",
  "we don't think so.",
  "it took two PRODUCT!",
  "...and they wanted to buy out BUSINESS ?",
  "thats interesting and yes very risky.",
  "oh, do you use your PRODUCT often?",
  "i didnt know about it.",
  "no it doesn't at all.",
  "yes, we are very close.",
  "it sounds interesting.",
  "yes, i have learned LANGUAGE as well.",
  "that seems counter intuitive doesn't it?",
  "love em.",
  "if you become OCCUPATION you can end it all.",
  "sure i will get to do that right now.",
  "oh that is pretty cool",
  "you to.",
  "yes i believe he is.",
  "it really can.",
  "it's been nice chatting with you.",
  "i bet that is pretty cool.",
  "they played almost 115 a SPORTS_SEASON.",
  "on a lighter PRODUCT.",
  "that was funny.",
  "PERSON surely does comedy well",
  "hey, she is not worth it.",
  "i'm going to need to see your id.",
  "i highly doubt they can.",
  "see yah!",
  "PERSON knew what was what.",
  "yup.",
  "i agree he was.",
  "i heard that too!",
  "i have never tried this.",
  "what do you think about this LAW?",
  "that's so cool!",
  "that is fascinating and makes me wonder how that's possible?",
  "i was on a FOOD and exercised daily.",
  "one smart OCCUPATION.",
  "LOCATION does.",
  "i must say i think that is very odd.",
  "yes because it is more comfortable when they play",
  "well, i won't keep you then.",
  "ok.",
  "that's crazy to think.",
  "maybe that was his favorite FOOD.",
  "oh, that's interesting!",
  "that's absolutely horrible and unacceptable.",
  "i think that is pretty funny that they would choose that one.",
  "yeah it really was.",
  "well, i will text to you.",
  "that is pretty wise.",
  "does that mean the stronger the better?",
  "you know you didn't.",
  "do you use PRODUCT much ?",

  "no, that ’ s all.",
  "i did not and that is truly incredible.",
  "i did not know until i read the PRODUCT.",
  "wow i did now know that!",

  "that is so cool.",
  "i've been once of twice.",

  "ok.here they are.",
  "that's pretty strong.",
  "he was so athletic i can see it.",
  "to begin with, i have to use PRODUCT.",

  "yes, i'm easy to please.",
  "$ 7.",
  "na... he would just pay someone to do that",

  "good, i like it.",
  "yep i would have lost too.",
  "right.",
  "2016.",
  "PERSON is still touring now.",
  "okay, this sounds a little tough, how am i supposed to practice for this?",
  "that was a good PRODUCT!",
  "that must have been cool.",
  "he's actually a smaller OCCUPATION.",
  "yeah if the PRODUCT can catch them they have to be",
  "ok, i would like to check out these WORK_OF_ART.",
  "that does sound pretty fun.",
  "i really think that could happen... sooner than later !",
  "harry.",
  "i didn't prepare it, but if you want, i can cook some.",
  "if you need anything else, please feel free to ask me",
  "everybody who walks past me sees it.",
  "sure, i'll sit right here.",
  "i think the POLITICAL_PARTY have been leading",
  "what LAW do you have now? :",
  "and it's been a while ago...back in 1995.",
  "that ’ s fine.",
  "WORK_OF_ART is great.",
  "that wasn't sarcastic.",
  "y",
  "oh wow that's odd.",
  "you truly never know.",
  "you don't have a PRODUCT?",
  "yep i agree with you on that.",
  "well, i need to polish up my LANGUAGE.",
  "i'm not sure he wanted to continue it.",

  "yes but i wonder how they enforce that",
  "well, i don't understand it very well.",
  "i am trying to submit but did not work",
  "i'm retired or semi-retired.",
  "i can't imagine how that would have worked.",
  "no but i have played TYPE_OF_SPORT.",

  "sorry i don't know about it",
  "and how many OCCUPATION do you employ?",
  "i'm glad to hear it.",
  "that ’ s just it!",
  "we just mow to keep it short enough to see our small ANIMAL.",
  "gotta love leap year!",
  "i think PERSON was better.",
  "no i haven't but wouldn't that be cool to hear.",
  "maybe if they created a WORK_OF_ART.",
  "ok.i'll talk to you later.",
  "you mean visit a BUSINESS?",
  "well...it was a WORK_OF_ART she'd played on us all.",
  "i go to LOCATION.",
  "i don't blame him.",
  "just do whatever you feel like doing.",
  "i don't see anything supporting or denying that NORP so we would never know for sure.",
  "yeah i went to visit FAC.",
  "oh no!",
  "whether you like someone or not you have to be respectful of them.",
  "it will begin at 5:30.",
  "not sure i have ever seen it.",
  "no, he didn't scold me because he was late, too.",
  "perhaps... as a LOCATION we have become to polarized.",
  "cya!",
  "you got rid of all your PRODUCT?",
  "that is nice of him.",
  "i honestly liked them all.",
  "even with EVENT.",
  "ok.i'll blow.",
  "i signed up somewhere around then too.",
  "i do not believe it.",
  "i don't like him.",
  "yep we are right in the right LOCATION huh.",
  "i think that i might.",
  "it's cool though isn't it?",
  "that is really wild!",
  "TYPE_OF_SPORT is physical.",
  "maybe if all we did was sit.",
  "will we be there soon?",
  "...so it's not mj who invented it ?",
  "it was very fun.",
  "i'm kind of glad that changed though with how different the political POLITICAL_PARTY are",
  "i tend to agree with that too.",
  "it's not at all.",
  "that is wild to think.",
  "i have other favorite TYPE_OF_SPORT but i do like it.",
  "yeah i would have to agree with you on both.",
  "that is always good.",
  "yeah. too much probably.",
  "ya i guess.",
  "yeah i guess there is so much MUSIC_GENRE everywhere now.",
  "i wonder why they are treated like that.",
  "i wouldn't do that.",
  "it was a OCCUPATION.",
  "i hate going to EVENT.",
  "yes, this is very light.",
  "yes i think so unfortunately.",
  "i read that somewhere.",
  "if you don ’ t like that, then you ’ re probably going to be mad at what i tell you next.",
  "how should i take this PRODUCT?",
  "yes i think i heard about that.",
  "are you sure ?",
  "what about the ORG?",
  "i wish i could remember.",
  "nope i've never snowboarded actually.",
  "then you can buy PRODUCT.",
  "i like to read PRODUCT.",
  "i haven't either but if he recommends it.",
  "i'm not too into TYPE_OF_SPORT but it's amazing how much it has developed.",
  "yeah she was perfect for it!",
  "pretty amazing.",
  "and who was it ?",
  "yes you are very right.",
  "here in LOCATION, it's six.",
  "i use that on the regular!",
  "how far should i go?",
  "that one  in LOCATION?",
  "where's my PRODUCT?",
  "i appreciate it, thank you.",
  "it's surprising that he's the only one!",
  "i liked him too.",
  "i'm not sure where you live.",
  "that i do not understand at all.",
  "i assume that would affect how our PRODUCT stands and perhaps make us warmer too?",
  "we just decided to stop seeing each other.",
  "i'm sorry i don't like it's a little too salty.",
  "that's all right",
  "yeah it involves human-like WORK_OF_ART.",
  "i'm always feeling hungry.",
  "i never really played the PRODUCT.",
  "that's pretty neat to know.",
  "about fourteen.",
  "i agree he seems like a great OCCUPATION.",
  "if you are referring to our current OCCUPATION.",
  "now that i'm not aware of. sounds horrific.",
  "i believe i've heard that before.",
  "poor mary!",
  "was that before they moved to LOCATION.",
  "just walk down this LOCATION and you'll find it.",
  "yeah i know there kicking themselves now.",
  "that's not a PRODUCT.",
  "i know of them.",
  "well, thank you for coming.",
  "right. same here.",
  "i will, thank you for calling.",
  "i just asked her and she sung me.",
  "wow that is well-deserved i think.",
  "that must be very dangerous!",
  "i'm very glad that someone did.",
  "oh word?",
  "not now.",
  "they teach regular WORK_OF_ART.",
  "so tell me about it!",
  "it looks like ORG is getting ready to step in since they wont change on their own.",
  "yeah the WORK_OF_ART are so long that it's tough to get really immersed.",
  "was there much bleeding afterward?",
  "you know what is kind of odd?",
  "i do think it's odd.",
  "but i don't see it.",
  "that is very scary indeed.",
  "i did and i liked it.",
  "i think that is what it means!",
  "i could see that because if they think he is injured they might not practice as hard.",
  "meant to say fairly.",
  "i never did like this PRODUCT anyway.",
  "i am pleading not guilty.",
  "you ’ re kidding me!",
  "that's also ridiculous.",
  "i wouldn't think that would happen youre right.",
  "maybe it had little microscopic PRODUCT.",
  "my ORG is the same.",
  "that works for me!",
  "i'll prepare it.",
  "that they are.",
  "hard to say.",
  "it is crazy when you think about it!",
  "yep that is probably what it is.",
  "yeah that is nice.",
  "i did have PRODUCT!",
  "so who has to stay behind?",
  "oh well, that's it.",
  "okay, see you then.",
  "i usually do.",
  "that's pretty shocking.",
  "well that is so cool.",
  "that is so odd and it seems a little unfair.",
  "don't worry, i will come to pick you up at about 6 thirty.",
  "is it good?",
  "what would you like for FOOD?",
  "yes i'll have to check that out.",
  "i admire you for that!",
  "i'd like to try it out.",
  "you should probably pay the LAW soon.",
  "are you scared of anything?",
  "burger king?",
  "smart!",
  "i do know who he is.",
  "no thats what i've heard.",
  "you were probably right.",
  "don't be so frightened.",
  "yes, we should go.",
  "if you want i'll let him know if i run into him.",
  "how'd i fail it?",
  "in 39 of 50 LOCATION.",
  "wow.i did not know that at all?",
  "ok.do you think you are proficient in both written and spoken LANGUAGE?",
  "oh yes that is interesting.",
  "i don't really use BUSINESS.",
  "i ’ m upset, too.",
  "ok, i ’ ll see you later.",
  "i have found i ’ m short-sighted recently.",
  "i should have known really.",
  "merry christmas!",
  "it was only 345 PRODUCT.",
  "that doesn't surprise me at all.",
  "that is such NORP.",
  "how about spicy FOOD?",
  "yes we need to check that out!",
  "that is so funny!",
  "do you listen to the PRODUCT much?",
  "probably not too powerful.",
  "yes i've heard of him.",
  "i have to think about it.",
  "i heard that they worked together to create BUSINESS.",
  "we have destroyed it.",
  "it was nice chatting with you.",
  "that's really cheap for PRODUCT like those.",
  "i do follow NORP.",
  "i wonder if we are close to that!",
  "ah that is nice.",
  "guess they regret that now!",
  "so you are not sure how long it will take to get there?",
  "and even with all of that bandwidth BUSINESS uses.",
  "no. TYPE_OF_SPORT isn't that popular in the us.",
  "there's something for everyone!",
  "ok, done.",
  "i am curious too.",
  "do you wear PRODUCT ?",
  "how does that work?",
  "that would not be fun!",
  "it sounds great, and is it really cool there?",
  "i did know that ironically.",
  "what does your PRODUCT look like?",
  "thats really thoughtful of him!",
  "they also invented volleyball.softball and TYPE_OF_SPORT.",
  "yeah that is exactly right.",
  "at 2 thirty.",
  "it would be worth looking into.",
  "why did you say that?",
  "omg!",
  "how would you feel about relocating to another LOCATION?",
  "i bet it really bytes... ha!",
  "i guess better safe than sorry.",
  "i know that is just so sad.",
  "i guess bb thought they would do it on their own.",
  "it is very sad.",
  "anything!",
  "so those FOOD are immortal only if they aren't eaten or poisoned or something?",
  "have you ever visited LOCATION?",
  "that's hilarious he thought it was scary.",
  "then we drive on the LOCATION.",
  "i think PERSON wrote a little about everything.",
  "thank you, but i've never thought about it before.",
  "see that scares me because i don't know why they would be blocked from the LOCATION.",
  "i do not really have one!",
  "don't forget about the FOOD.",
  "i enjoy it too!",
  "i'm afraid that's the best we can do.",
  "mom!",
  "i also use PRODUCT.",
  "looks like it.",
  "i didn't know who made it famous.",
  "yes that was in 1986 but it is gone now",
  "i'm sure it probably is.",
  "she also has a OCCUPATION.",
  "me. 1960.",
  "he likes his WORK_OF_ART.",
  "but i'm not sure if they're well-rcceived.",
  "yeah that's really weird.",
  "let's ask someone else.",
  "i guess they figure that it wont affect them or they wont understand it anyway.",
  "ah. ACADEMIC_DISCIPLINE.",
  "let's look at our PRODUCT.",
  "yeah, it will be fun!",
  "i would like to see either someone else in there.",
  "wow -- i should google that.",
  "it fits well.",
  "i have heard some call his new EVENT empty.",
  "what would you like anything to drink or you wait?",
  "they could have.",
  "bye!!",
  "i never even heard of that.",
  "sometimes you might feel dizzy, but that isn ’ t common.",
  "as long they are kept on fm.",
  "i see you have bought some FOOD.",
  "i am NORP",
  "how many?",
  "you are very lucky to have such a nice ORG.",
  "ya that's what i was wondering.",
  "no, that's not me.",
  "i guess we may not know.",
  "when did you send her a WORK_OF_ART?",
  "i have two ANIMAL but have not noticed that",
  "i do not think they are alive.",
  "they may want to know how the BUSINESS will benefit and why they should hire you?",
  "i thought it was ok",
  "thats just crazy.",
  "yes, it was.",
  "ya that is interesting.",
  "wow i didn't know that either.",
  "i think that is because our LOCATION are longer than other countries'.",
  "i didn't know anyone did that any more.",
  "that seems like it would be painful!",
  "now that you mention it.",
  "illegal?!?!?",
  "i ’ m sorry, but until you pay it, you won ’ t be able to check out any more WORK_OF_ART.",
  "i don't understand.",
  "it was always very busy there.",
  "it is indeed.",
  "ok, i can do that.",
  "i see why you didn't stop.",
  "unfortunately not.",
  "have you ever worked?",
  "that would work too.",
  "and you're planning to enter?",
  "oh, no, are they back?",
  "oh wow!",
  "if only FOOD was healthy.",
  "wouldn't that be something to see!",
  "oh, she's nice.",
  "yeah i've never seen it done either!",
  "i have just heard about it.",
  "well... i actually don't even know how to respond to that.",
  "yeah they are good at that.",
  "i enjoyed it very much!!",
  "yes and all you have to do is feed it plastic PRODUCT",
  "i knew she was good.",
  "that ought to be pretty interesting!",
  "i thought it was older than that too!",
  "and when will it be ok?",
  "i am going to go play my PRODUCT now.",
  "i am fearful to say what he will be remembered for.",
  "i think it is in LOCATION.",
  "interesting to know.",
  "sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't.",
  "she is okay.",
  "the SPORTS_EVENT is pretty amazing.",
  "no he doesn't look that old and wow!",
  "sawdust?",
  "it ’ s double a, r, o, n.",
  "ah. thank you.",
  "i used to as well.",
  "that's too complicated.",
  "yeah they did and all he had to do is spend less than $30",
  "no i don't like to watch that i think it's really boring.",
  "that is concerning.",
  "o",
  "how much were you supposed to write it for?",
  "i haven't seen it.",
  "well that is interesting.",
  "yes, you'll be in a different LOCATION there.",
  "it's so busy here.",
  "ok, i ’ ll try my best.",
  "do you read sf?",
  "they would innovate..",
  "but she can ’ t be home now.",
  "well that definitely says something.",
  "and his PRODUCT was unique too.",
  "there are only 9 OCCUPATION.",
  "but i need it.",
  "hmm i wonder too.",
  "i don't know what to think about that.",
  "ya they did.",
  "i don't think the ORG.",
  "i agree that he should receive something.",
  "im truly sorry to hear that.",
  "sure, that sounds good.",
  "that's cool to know.",
  "i have read that before.",
  "WORK_OF_ART and comedy also!",
  "oh yeah very much so.",
  "interesting WORK_OF_ART.",
  "i know... isn't that crazy!",
  "may i ask you for a EVENT?",
  "i cannot see him being anything else but a ACADEMIC_DISCIPLINE though",
  "i heard that",
  "yeah probably not well!",
  "you mean you're going to ask her out in a WORK_OF_ART?",
  "i'd love to be able to see it.",
  "yeah its not like the BUSINESS where you just arent physically ready.",
  "it was with ORG.",
  "it certainly was!",
  "what are they all for?",
  "there's one at 19 and the next is at 19 forty.",
  "probably very similar.",
  "i find it interesting that it was PERSON who had them installed",
  "that is cool to think about.",
  "it used to i agree.",
  "i'll take you, if you'd like.",
  "well knowing him.",
  "please go to receive ACADEMIC_DISCIPLINE first over there.",
  "you sure don't.",
  "i always considered them different also.",
  "i dont think youd need a PRODUCT to hear him from there.",
  "he doesn't even disguise it.",
  "right, then you'd better send an e-PRODUCT to tell her.",
  "i would have never guessed that.",
  "well, i understand.",
  "i do remember reading that.",
  "i felt that the FOOD was pretty mediocre.",
  "okay, that ’ s fine.",
  "definitely over 130.745.",
  "yes i have heard about that and was surprised!",
  "for only $72 million!",
  "i saw one about a towing BUSINESS.",
  "i loved BUSINESS.",
  "i have heard that they understand pointing.",
  "sure, speak to you later.",
  "yes i for to mention where.",
  "where's the BUSINESS?",
  "i used to watch it daily.",
  "perhaps you would like some PRODUCT.",
  "i could see that being really interesting.",
  "did you know why they discontinued ?",
  "what did she do for LOCATION?",
  "no! not at all.",
  "yeah those are really nice.",
  "not for much longer.",
  "PERSON should do the same.",
  "don't worry, i'll make sure and get to sleep in a little while.",
  "that seems inefficient.",
  "no she doesnt.",
  "it's only 10 PRODUCT long.",
  "but you look quite proficient in using them now.",
  "it was nice chatting with you too.",
  "that would be the worst!",
  "how much did she ask for?",
  "yep i like that too.",
  "i never ever heard that about him.",
  "then, why didn't you do that?",
  "i know it does, and that's because it is.",
  "i love that they are assigning WORK_OF_ART to help train.",
  "that would be an interesting EVENT.",
  "now that is unique.",
  "i have myself!",
  "yep he was just doing what he like to do.",
  "i was when i was growing up.",
  "i guess i never thought of that before.",
  "hahaha true!",
  "it's a medium PRODUCT.",
  "ya that was probably what that was.",
  "i'm not thrilled by it.",
  "different PRODUCT.",
  "oh wow that's interesting.",
  "i bet lol!",
  "no. though i've heard of it.",
  "no i never saw that one either.",
  "i guess he must be worth that much to the BUSINESS.",
  "done!",
  "i'm serious, have you?",
  "i actually saw something about that.",
  "there is probably this ORG wouldnt do to stay relevant",
  "is he allergic to FOOD?",
  "i admit.",
  "and that is just the us.",
  "it sounds great.",
  "i don't know what else to drink.",
  "well, i can help you pack.",
  "i've heard about that but never looked much into it.",
  "how would you like to pay for it?",
  "i'll have to PRODUCT it.",
  "i never saw the WORK_OF_ART.",
  "ok.see you then.",
  "if you were bored of your FOOD.",
  "they are overpriced.",
  "what else would you like to add?",
  "she is reading a PRODUCT.",
  "ok. enjoy!",
  "i will have to find that one.",
  "yes i like playing at two",
  "haven't seen it myself.",
  "i didn't know he played.",
  "i'm guessing that too.",
  "i would definitely still be scared.",
  "i really like nice PRODUCT.",
  "he was indeed good at it though.",
  "i guess its positive for his WORK_OF_ART i agree.",
  "i hadn't heard about that one.",
  "well, go home and rest up.",
  "probably 2.",
  "have you ever attend a live EVENT?",
  "awesome",
  "i'm so humiliated!",
  "because it was easy to dial on a rotary PRODUCT",
  "providence, rhode island.",
  "i would love it if it wasn't always so unpredictable.",
  "yeah i do not know either.",
  "no, how much is it worth?",
  "sorry to hear that but i can understand.",
  "yes maybe you're right.",
  "i ’ m an ACADEMIC_DISCIPLINE.",
  "there's nothing definite i think.",
  "i like FOOD.",
  "that doesnt sound like a good NORP.",
  "in LOCATION, yes.",
  "i wonder how that will be treated in the WORK_OF_ART.",
  "but it's cold in LOCATION!",
  "all about that synergy!",
  "i don't know exactly what they talk about.",
  "yes, you do.",
  "it's possible that he did.",
  "i believe i have heard something similar.",
  "yes it was nice to chat with you as well!",
  "well not 100 PRODUCT.",
  "i'm not sure i understand what you are asking?",
  "i am not going to even attempt that.",
  "that's even cooler :)",
  "i don't think i could do it.",
  "i find that they are pretty progressive with some of their NORP.",
  "it must be really painful.",
  "that is pretty old!",
  "you did what?",
  "at least not enough to beat the other two.",
  "they are a ORG i would like to listen to more.",
  "yeah i'd be the same.",
  "you could move to LOCATION.",
  "thats sweet.",
  "yep that's impressive!",
  "very smart.",
  "i never knew that..wow",
  "1600",
  "no .how",
  "i guess they are allowed to play if it need be",
  "you mean you haven't arranged any PRODUCT.",
  "it's very inexpensive, and it has all the PRODUCT.",
  "yeah maybe he can get with LOCATION.",
  "i had not heard that one.",
  "don't plan to watch it.",
  "i liked him back when he signed to BUSINESS in 2009.",
  "i think it's inspirational.",
  "yeah it is a big LOCATION indeed.",
  "that is not very long at all!",
  "i guess ill do that as well.",
  "i'm pretty sure he's a WORK_OF_ART.",
  "i'll have a FOOD, medium rare.",
  "says he was well known for his homophobic WORK_OF_ART early on",
  "ha. not blue.",
  "oh ok that is cool.",
  "i could have swore they played recently.",
  "but now he is in the LOCATION",
  "miss, i just can't help you on this.",
  "an BUSINESS.",
  "in a cushioned PRODUCT, please.",
  "what do you like about exactly?",
  "here you go.",
  "that PRODUCT seems kind of primitive i wonder why",
  "you sound like me.",
  "not i did not see that",
  "he's great in WORK_OF_ART.",
  "and nothing gets done.",
  "you must feel really worried right now.",
  "all right, let's fix it at 450 PRODUCT then.",
  "yeah and they still use more on PRODUCT than bandwidth",
  "a little more advanced than his PRODUCT!",
  "it must be fun.",
  "very impressive.",
  "i don't know what that looks...",
  "o.k., o.k., i ’ ll go.",
  "i said, 11:30 am.",
  "it feels good.",
  "i must have slept right through it.",
  "it is pretty amazing that he learned how to drive at 3.",
  "i wonder what it sounds like.",
  "very well, go ahead.",
  "yeah, i think so too.",
  "ha ha !",
  "i know what you mean.",
  "yes, next saturday.",
  "apparently he was pretty good.",
  "i know i agree.",
  "yes it is very haunting.",
  "i wonder how and why?",
  "and then i just sign here?",
  "i have heard that.",
  "it's frankly very disgusting and unfair.",
  "i would love to see that :)",
  "oh that is nice.",
  "well, it is not going to happen so soon, i guess.",
  "i had to make it quick.",
  "yeah i think i know what you are talking about.",
  "they just might!",
  "i have heard of them yes.",
  "i believe PERSON was born in '83.",
  "that sounds really tasty.",
  "that's very good!",
  "ya isn't that awesome!",
  "my OCCUPATION is really picky about that.",
  "it's nice.",
  "look what you did to my rear PRODUCT.",
  "that would make me suspicious of what is going on there.",
  "ya i'm not sure on that.",
  "i don't know how well they would play though.",
  "yes, miss.",
  "yeah i definitely think she does that.",
  "did you ever watch WORK_OF_ART.",
  "that makes it easy.",
  "i don't use PRODUCT.",
  "yeah did you know we use them to figure out stufffor ourselves",
  "from july the seventh to the ninth.",
  "is she your OCCUPATION?",
  "not sure since i don't play as well either.",
  "no. can you pick it up on am or fm PRODUCT?",
  "i'm really not sure.",
  "i still think we should have a BUSINESS.",
  "yes that was back in 1936 but not sure what happened to it",
  "who wouldn't?",
  "that is so bizarre.",
  "i did not hear about that.",
  "oh, sorry.",
  "i'm excited for it.",
  "parodies?",
  "i'll bet you were a little embarrassed.",
  "as far as i can see.",
  "i used to have one.",
  "256-7797.",
  "i don't know if i could do that.",
  "i hope it hasn't left without me.",
  "i think everyone does!",
  "yeah that's definitely scary.",
  "i have to download it.",
  "hm!",
  "i have four very large PRODUCT.",
  "no i dont really.",
  "that may be it.",
  "do you think that i should get a new PRODUCT?",
  "it will be just more of what we have already.",
  "i agree they never would.",
  "i can't believe there were so many.",
  "alright, i'm twisting it around.",
  "but, well... what i want to say is...",
  "what exactly is a legendary WORK_OF_ART?",
  "do you follow TYPE_OF_SPORT?",
  "i can't think of any.",
  "yeah i did read that somewhere.",
  "ya i'm not sure.",
  "my ORG used to own a cadillac.",
  "would you wear it?",
  "that is so silly!",
  "after i've eaten, it goes away for a while.",
  "i agree with you on that!",
  "i appreciate that the ORG would want to interview them.",
  "yeah me too!",
  "until the early WORK_OF_ART.",
  "that sounds pretty amazing.",
  "although some seem seem shallow.",
  "at seven, please.",
  "i'm dreadfully sorry.",
  "probably helped her.",
  "well, you are over at LOCATION.",
  "i do watch her sometimes.",
  "well, anything is better than nothing.",
  "it's hard not to.",
  "i misunderstood.",
  "don't take too long.",
  "you have an BUSINESS with us, right?",
  "who would steal my PRODUCT?",
  "please tell me exactly what happened.",
  "yeah those.",
  "33?",
  "oh ew.",
  "i didn't not know that.",
  "ok i'm gonna have to PRODUCT that one",
  "it's expensive for me.",
  "i used to listen to the PRODUCT.",
  "damnnnnn.",
  "so do i.this is LOCATION.",
  "ok, i will get right to that.",
  "that is too bad they deserve better than that!",
  "i actually do not know that.",
  "i expect there will.",
  "yes, i know i'm wrong.",
  "i wonder where they lived before that.",
  "i'm sorry to hear that, but you don't need to quit over that.",
  "i didn't hear about him.",
  "that is unreal.",
  "they appear to know who they are talking to and can communicate with one another.",
  "do you have an PRODUCT?",
  "i shall.",
  "oh wow that is funny.",
  "there you go!",
  "of what?",
  "oh, i nearly forget it.",
  "it is possible.",
  "that would be cool to find out.",
  "yes i think so.",
  "you just have to build up a NORP.",
  "maybe we all should learn something from him.",
  "is it very dangerous?",
  "it probably is the lightest around.",
  "i am more surprised that most of them are \"old\" OCCUPATION.",
  "how often do you exercise?",
  "wow - i did not know that.",
  "i've been there before.",
  "they are very popular.",
  "sorry, but we can't do that.",
  "PERSON is there as well.",
  "yes and he was also the only losing OCCUPATION there",
  "peace out!",
  "the OCCUPATION will let you know.",
  "they are fun to watch.",
  "i do not know maybe it works for them.",
  "im not sure if i believe that one.",
  "nope but if they get stuck together it is hard to separate them",
  "do you know how far you will be from the FAC at 5?",
  "ah, umm, kind of.",
  "it will be $ 850.",
  "is it serious?",
  "yes, i did.",
  "since discovered in 1846 i guess.",
  "the game of thrones guy?",
  "the non-mainstream NORP produce something pure and relevant.",
  "it might be because i live in urban LOCATION.",
  "yeah i think thats a really funny NORP.",
  "fortunately i know enough to hang up.",
  "super mario bros for sure!",
  "i hope there is.",
  "i totally agree with you.",
  "you're being serious?",
  "no, he's from LOCATION.",
  "that's very scary.",
  "yes. looks fun.",
  "i do not think so",
  "how do i know if it's blown out?",
  "it is awful.",
  "oh, i bet it's really quiet.",
  "i don't",
  "no i haven't what is that?",
  "oops!",
  "i dont know how much it helps.",
  "somewhat",
  "oh wow that is very interesting yes like you say it is definitely changing.",
  "it was a modest FAC.",
  "well, i believe it now, and when are they are getting marry?",
  "you are so pessimistic!",
  "i like that FAC as well.",
  "mr. : but not big enough.",
  "yes it has been very enlightening.",
  "yeah i would say that is what 90% of them are doing now.",
  "PRODUCT has been doing so much for us.",
  "i did not realize it was so young.",
  "i wonder why it was 1 PRODUCT.",
  "i cannot imagine how anyone got it up there.",
  "he's quite a patient OCCUPATION, too.",
  "ok, here you are.",
  "it's possible that he was.",
  "i know PERSON tried it.",
  "you look pretty upset.",
  "well then, this could be a nice EVENT to enjoy it together.",
  "yes, but i don't really use it that often.",
  "maybe just educated in ACADEMIC_DISCIPLINE.",
  "yeah apparently she might have even been better than him.",
  "so nice to speak with you!",
  "i am really pleased with it.",
  "yes likewise.",
  "that would be really cool to see in LOCATION.",
  "why did you decide to apply for this OCCUPATION?",
  "he was probably inspired by what he saw.",
  "oh i did!",
  "probably the PRODUCT.",
  "you really think we can make it?",
  "well it sounds great to me!",
  "i don't know if they did or not.",
  "well, they ' re not here.",
  "i do like MUSIC_GENRE in general.",
  "that ’ s a nice PRODUCT.",
  "ok, i will arrange it for you.",
  "yet he invented the TYPE_OF_SPORT.",
  "i heard about that now.",
  "i typically watch on my tv.",
  "that is just too nuts.",
  "can you imagine that now?",
  "have a night!",
  "i am not sure as well.",
  "did they fly?",
  "up to 1000 and they can reason better than WORK_OF_ART",
  "i really wonder about that too.",
  "i wonder how it is in the eu.",
  "no i didn't what did they do?",
  "i would definitely not recognize him.",
  "i try to.",
  "probably both if it is affordable.",
  "i am guessing not.",
  "i definitely am not one of those 7%.",
  "yeah it's really good you should check it out.",
  "there's so much that our PRODUCT can do.",
  "probably big in LOCATION.",
  "en?",
  "i enjoyed it!",
  "nope i do not know",
  "yeah and it aint over.",
  "one can only hope...",
  "i've just been working really hard.",
  "wow i wonder why that is.",
  "well, all right.",
  "agreed on it being inexpensive.",
  "that could have something to do with it!",
  "yeah that would be super fun.",
  "yes he is and he was not even mentioned at all in it",
  "oh yeah he was great.",
  "are there any more?",
  "thats so true.",
  "shall i go ahead and process them for you?",
  "i totally agree plus i already paid for the FOOD and drinks there.",

  "given all the powerful ORG sitting right there.",
  "my kids!",
  "it is so funny.",
  "some of it is so out there.",
  "never heard of them.",
  "that's one EVENT that they'll never forget.",
  "yup we just do not like to read all that fine PRODUCT.",
  "he might be allergic to pollen.",
  "that is very intense.",
  "well i want to go to the ORG for sure.",
  "the PRODUCT is more expensive.",
  "ya apparently those LAW are almost never enacted.",
  "no i did now that .",
  "even though nothing was dEVENT at this last EVENT.",
  "if we played while on a stationary PRODUCT.",
  "how come?",
  "they dont complain.",
  "i hope he doesn't retire.",
  "how long will it take to get the regular one?",
  "let ’ s call them right now.",
  "they must be popular.",
  "no i haven't heard about him.",
  "that's a strange LAW - i never heard of that before.",
  "no, seriously...",
  "i think i can manage that.",
  "then what about you?",
  "i'm single.",
  "i think those NATION are just trying to be different!",
  "that's too bad!",
  "is 2:30 okay?",
  "i use PRODUCT as well.",

  "it would be interesting for sure.",
  "very old PRODUCT.",
  "actually, i ’ ve got something scheduled on monday.",
  "well most jelly FOOD are see through.",
  "it could be worse.",
  "ok, here you go.",
  "i can ’ t go any higher than $ 850.",
  "thats true i just cant take him seriously after seeing him in WORK_OF_ART.",
  "not all the same nowadays i must say.",
  "wow thats awhile ago.",
  "those are pretty cool.",
  "this isn't letting me submit...",
  "92.",
  "definitely heard of it.",
  "i've read that.",
  "yeah i think he did.",
  "ya i would imagine.",
  "well it was good talking to you.",
  "was that in LOCATION?",

  "actually, i'm eating the same FOOD.",
  "cut the PRODUCT.",
  "not until now.",
  "hey, it's not that bad.",
  "i think he has what it takes.",
  "i agree completely.",
  "i would agree.",
  "i have never heard that.",
  "the NATION weren't happy they censored it either and thought it was empowering rather than insulting",
  "possibly could have been.",
  "thats fascinating.",
  "that must be a big LOCATION.",
  "i'd like to see that myself.",
  "can i buy PRODUCT here?",
  "or PRODUCT.",
  "she doesn't like her WORK_OF_ART taken either and walks backwards to avoid having it taken.",
  "well. was there public watching ?",
  "i am not sure!",
  "around six pm.",
  "she's lucky she has her own ORG to help out.",
  "i couldnt pick one.",
  "i don't think there's any LAW.",
  "i love BUSINESS as well.",
  "they do so much now.",
  "how about the PRODUCT?",
  "i would love to see a EVENT there.",
  "probably pretty good.",
  "yeah maybe that is why they discontinued it.",
  "ya i heard about that that was crazy.",
  "while you are researching.",
  "no, he is.",
  "i probably helped with that.",
  "FAC, i think.",
  "then you apply the PRODUCT, which is very easy.",
  "they ended up shutting it down though.",
  "that is scary to think.",
  "maybe it's because he has never eaten a FOOD.",
  "i wonder how many PRODUCT he went through?",
  "when will we get one of those?",
  "is he still in the SPORTS_LEAGUE?",
  "indeed it does.",
  "since 1997.",
  "yes, fine.",
  "they might actually understand the LANGUAGE!",
  "i've been studying for my LAW.",
  "you should try it sometime.",
  "okay, i'll do that.",
  "wow... did not realize that!",
  "i ’ m sure she is.",
  "ya i would have never guessed that.",
  "at least the LOCATION is well fertilized.",
  "where in LOCATION are you from?",
  "yeah i would like to know more about that as well.",
  "yeah i wonder how they even measure that though to be honest",
  "it's friday.",
  "so the BUSINESS is kind of regressive about that.",
  "i wasn't aware of that!",
  "that could be your WORK_OF_ART.",
  "oh, thank you for pointing that out.",
  "i'll send someone up right away.",
  "well i guess she didn't see it firsthand.",
  "no did not hear about that.",
  "not all of them did.",
  "i guess PERSON was there and spoke.",
  "i guess that's how we spread around the LOCATION so well.",
  "i'm afraid i can't dance well.",
  "it's nice to hear that anyway.",
  "no, but we have it in yellow.",
  "what's that about?",
  "i think there was one out of the many that he didn't appear in.",
  "indeed they are.",
  "yeah there is no knowing there.",
  "from 9pm to 12am.",
  "do you know who invented the PRODUCT?",
  "the remote PRODUCT doesn't work.",
  "i haven't heard it yet.",
  "she sounds super expensive...",
  "that would be fun to here!",
  "that sounds exciting.",
  "i love both of them.",
  "they are pretty awesome!",
  "wouldn't it be great if it still was?",
  "i will definitely check that out.",
  "yes, please tell her i stopped by.",
  "i need to do that more often.",
  "you can't write with one PRODUCT and draw with the other.",
  "neither does mine.",
  "pretty interesting.",
  "the OCCUPATION from bergen county new jersey?",
  "lol !",
  "how do you stick to only those FOOD?",
  "golf?",
  "i could see him drawing comic WORK_OF_ART.",
  "i don't think he needs to...",
  "$1?!",
  "nothing seems to be happier for them.",
  "that sounds vaguely familiar but i am not sure.",
  "yes...... when i was in ORG",
  "ok.ok.i don't want to haggle with you.",
  "we haven't decided yet.",
  "$ 2.",
  "do you ORG foo fighters?",
  "that's so odd.",
  "it was nice talking to you too.",
  "yes, there is, drinking your FOOD!",
  "ahh that's fair.",
  "that would be hilarious.",
  "i hate it when good ORG break up.",
  "i can play a little.",
  "yeah i am curious when it will actually come out.",
  "yes and then after that he gets $32 million",
  "not just any FOOD.",
  "i only have small PRODUCT.",
  "i feel like ive heard before",
  "what does that even mean?",
  "i do audible mostly.",
  "that's $ 1 825.",

  "but there's a lovely LOCATION.",
  "did anyone get hurt?",
  "i'm not being pessimistic.",
  "for what day?",
  "it's horrible.",
  "moving to LOCATION?",
  "then, have you looked downstairs?",
  "a little too restful!",
  "yeah i just hated the WORK_OF_ART.",
  "i have never thought of that.",
  "they can't be very large.",
  "oh, hey, how about a new PRODUCT?",
  "they are discussing his PRODUCT.",
  "yeah, are you going to come?",
  "yeah i guess it is.",
  "mostly instrumental now MUSIC_GENRE has changed so much.",
  "i like some WORK_OF_ART",
  "yes i am too.",
  "bye...",
  "no i didn't hear about that.",
  "isn't there an earlier one?",
  "that seems illogical.",
  "it ’ s open from 6:30 a.m.to 10 p.m.every day.",
  "let me repeat that back to you.",
  "i have heard of WORK_OF_ART.",
  "the PRODUCT shows it to be counterfeit.",
  "no. thats odd.",
  "i am familiar with it.",
  "137 million worldwide!",
  "yes, that's just fine.",
  "yeah i am subscribed to BUSINESS.",
  "that is so good to hear!",
  "well its been great talking with you :)",

  "it should be in the LOCATION",
  "so do you also like MUSIC_GENRE?",
  "well, off we go.",
  "yeah that's pretty cool though you know?",
  "alaska?",
  "i'm not sure how that worked.",
  "i'm pretty jaded when it comes to ORG.",

  "no unfortunately i can't speak LANGUAGE.",
  "ew!",
  "go left.",
  "i did not know that what PRODUCT is that from?",
  "mmm, i like it.",
  "we surely believe you.",
  "maybe we should call someone and let them know.",
  "sorry, but i've gotta run.",
  "i cant say i did.",
  "i suppose that's fair.",
  "what will happen next?",
  "i doubt i will end up buying it.",
  "i recently learned that until 1805.",
  "yes. use every PRODUCT of it.",
  "not much.",
  "that's good for him!",
  "i would love to see a different EVENT.",
  "yes he was good at impersonating OCCUPATION that is why",
  "yeah well it was a great EVENT",
  "it's great",
  "i wonder how that worked!!",
  "all right, see you then.",
  "that would be so cool to see.",
  "we'll make it except a FOOD.",

  "i have to admit.",
  "oh, that's where i'm going.",
  "no. do you have a PRODUCT?",
  "i use too.",
  "how did you know that?",
  "i'd heard about that in something before.",
  "i don't want to look it up on BUSINESS since i'll be very upset.",
  "that's true but its only started happening more recently.",
  "cubs!",
  "salesman?",
  "yes that is interesting.",
  "i am not surprised actually.",
  "right...it almost seems like WORK_OF_ART.",
  "i'm not familiar with their MUSIC_GENRE.",
  "yeah, it was scary but exhilarating.",
  "where can i get some of that?",
  "and yet we are so terrified of them.",
  "i'm sure we will!",
  "no i do not think any have tried to get drafted but if they want they can.",
  "that is surprising.",
  "its the SPORT_TEAM",
  "you said she used to?",
  "i would like to order my FOOD now.",
  "i use both PRODUCT equally.",
  "and it's available on BUSINESS.",
  "darn!",
  "i think it unwise for either of us to be inflexible.",
  "ya you'd think so.",
  "i'm sort of surprised by that.",
  "there are too many to name.",
  "can you even hear what he's saying?",
  "it looks like.",
  "and they did.",
  "yeah and they have one like that in LOCATION as well",
  "the PRODUCT.",

  "dvd?",
  "at the BUSINESS.",
  "what????",
  "i remember it was something like that.",
  "yes it is actually warner bros",
  "i wonder if LOCATION intended to protest too?",
  "you misunderstood me.",
  "oh, aren't you afraid?",
  "i don't think the OCCUPATION cares too much.",
  "well they are very NORP oriented so",
  "it probably has.",
  "yes and then he gets a LAW of $32 million",
  "i like PRODUCT better.",
  "sad to think that might be true.",
  "probably not that often.",
  "certainly, i'll be going.",
  "that is really funny.",
  "should we walk?",
  "i like playing TYPE_OF_SPORT but i've never been able to dunk.",
  "i kind of skipped that PRODUCT.",
  "we'll notify you if necessary.",
  "i promise i will.",
  "if it's locally owned that is probably why they've sold out every PRODUCT since 1960.",
  "so i don't have to pay anything?",
  "it's much better than my old one.",
  "it seems it very specific to what you do.",
  "its in LOCATION.",
  "nowadays.",
  "why didn't you just ask me?",
  "i would not want to.",
  "maine is beautiful!",
  "that would have been something.",
  "i have something else to remind you of.",
  "i think it is reasonably likely.",
  "i don't know which is most roughest.",
  "hey, come on.",
  "eh. not so much anymore.",
  "i'm not surprised...",
  "the WORK_OF_ART probably don't translate culturally.",
  "what must i do next?",
  "yeah he does seem like a quiet OCCUPATION.",
  "i didn't know that either.",
  "i also feel it's nice.",
  "yeah i guess that is true.",
  "i have a ANIMAL!",
  "i have never seen LOCATION.",
  "i wonder who are older than them?",
  "i think they were in the POLITICAL_PARTY.",
  "i can't stand talking about it anymore.",
  "oh my. seems never ending.",
  "i do not think so.",
  "yep i was too.",
  "that is quite considerate!",
  "the LOCATION are great there.",
  "and that's why bad OCCUPATION get fired very quickly.",
  "as much as i can?",
  "is it washable?",
  "i'm not sure but they are annoying!",
  "sounds right.",
  "i dont think i even saw that one.",
  "so funny.",
  "i think it is totally awesome!",
  "that's pretty legit.",
  "i am not either.",
  "yes i saw that he sold it for 27.500 euros.",
  "or maybe they would if they had to.",
  "but they won't!",
  "but we also need physical PRODUCT of everything.",
  "yeah i head about that one.",
  "i guess so because they created it.",
  "wow i had never heard that.",
  "i hope!",
  "did you know that pilgrims only wear black on special EVENT?",
  "i have read that.",
  "what about PRODUCT.",
  "i would have deleted them all!",
  "where can we climb it?",
  "that's very nice to know!",
  "no worries!",
  "why don ’ t you run off with him?",
  "i'm always amazed they can find so much to talk about.",
  "the 70s show?",
  "i might have seen it.",
  "BUSINESS dominates.",
  "yes i am aware with him.",
  "i also am curious as to why that would be.",
  "silly boy!",
  "yeah it's pretty good.",
  "she is definitely an WORK_OF_ART of her own.",
  "it's owned by BUSINESS.",
  "i know that is cool.",
  "maybe that would jinx them!",
  "oh, i ’ m sorry.",
  "i wonder what makes you do that?",
  "are you sure about that?",
  "no that is really sad.",
  "that would be so amazing to see that.",
  "that's pretty interesting.",
  "love poe.",
  "i do enjoy reading.",
  "yeah i don't know.",
  "that is such a nice little WORK_OF_ART.",
  "what would you like for a FOOD?",
  "i thought he retired too!",
  "wow i wonder what happened there.",
  "i'm not sure how they could.",
  "was there something wrong with it?",
  "do you sell direct to BUSINESS?",
  "cool word!",
  "yeah i could see that happening for sure.",
  "i haven't yet.",
  "so you are saying that all of the NORP have got it wrong?",
  "could very well be.",
  "ORG may not have toured much.",
  "probably more fun.",
  "we did this while drinking.",
  "i would like to make one right now.",
  "yes he is that good",
  "yes, here is my id PRODUCT.",
  "i know i had heard about that before.",
  "that's very cool!",
  "and PERSON is batwoman?",
  "that's so petty.",
  "that's right, i have to work.",
  "yeah i read about that too.",
  "lol..maybe because he uses his own FOOD",
  "what do you think of it?",
  "ok, you could borrow one of PRODUCT.",
  "and yet so handy.",
  "no i missed that one",
  "i wonder how though.",
  "i wonder how did they learn it then.",
  "that's true...",
  "so, are you still going to have FOOD?",
  "i love TYPE_OF_SPORT very much.",
  "no. had not idea although a wooden PRODUCT seems dangerous.",
  "i've actually seen it!",
  "i have read that they can actually enter the PRODUCT",
  "well logging.",
  "i am going to go to the BUSINESS.",
  "is LOCATION affordable?",
  "i meant to say my wife's ORG.",
  "it is probably to cool them.",
  "it's possible, isn't it?",
  "how do we get to the FAC from here?",
  "she is hilarious.",
  "i hope i can stay here longer.",
  "yes i love dogs u",
  "i somehow believe that.",
  "it ’ s sent to mr. PERSON.",
  "how about connecticut?",
  "well, just a little thin.",
  "what about my PRODUCT?",
  "not cancelled.",
  "i am surprised that it's even 7%.",
  "yeah it probably was for sure.",
  "there you go :).",
  "it is funny.",
  "maybe if i sold my PRODUCT now, i wouldn't be so tempted to use it.",
  "you're right...",
  "$ 10.",
  "i enjoy TYPE_OF_SPORT.",
  "i didnt know that it was because it got tested LOCATION.",
  "i am studying LANGUAGE.",
  "have you ever seen a live PRODUCT?",
  "yes they are not suspended.",

  "sorry, i couldn ’",
  "i'd love to work for them.",
  "oh, right.",
  "i wonder were the current OCCUPATION ranks among them",
  "he played for the SPORT_TEAM correct?",
  "it does seem like it would be possible when you think about it.",
  "i totally agree!",
  "i heard that somewhere.",
  "that ’ s it?",
  "okay thank you.",
  "does the tv have BUSINESS?",
  "it only sounds complicated.",
  "night.",

  "i'm glad to hear that.",
  "i think it has",
  "yes i really do love TYPE_OF_SPORT.",
  "ok. better discuss another PRODUCT.",

  "there are two more, one is orange and the other is pink.",
  "it's 600,000 rib.but",
  "no that is shocking.",
  "yes i think that is pretty cool.",
  "no, i hate swimming.",
  "they were great at managing it.",
  "doesn't make them better for me.",
  "yep you don't learn that in LOCATION.",
  "yeah i read that.",
  "i am i like pretty much most TYPE_OF_SPORT.",
  "well, i recommend you to choose the 100 % PRODUCT.",
  "i hope we do something about ACADEMIC_DISCIPLINE soon.",
  "it depends on how long they were doing it.",
  "we really believe that you are a highly qualified OCCUPATION.",
  "yep it was definitely very popular!",
  "that's bad.",
  "it is very interesting to know.",

  "yes they probably are.",
  "i'd totally die if she turned me down.",
  "how does 11",
  "i wear PRODUCT if it is cold outside.",
  "sadly i'm not.",
  "it's probably better to be something like an OCCUPATION: educated.",
  "oh so.",
  "i don't have really favorite.",
  "he's an old WORK_OF_ART, very serious.",
  "i ’ m not sure about that.",
  "i don't know how but i need to look into that as well!",

  "is there anything else that we need?",
  "nope definitely not i only use a streaming BUSINESS now.",
  "wow what weird PRODUCT there are.",
  "that's pretty scary to think about.",
  "i wonder what it's made of that they would ban it like that?",
  "he plays outside right",
  "he still isn't worth as much as PERSON though!",
  "how unlucky!",
  "they do make good PRODUCT.",
  "ok.can i serve you anything else?",
  "getting there.",
  "hmm i really doubt that.",
  "stellar point!",
  "isnt that where PERSON is from?",
  "that is really nice.",
  "no, it isn't.",
  "i felt that it was okay.",
  "i think so as well!",
  "that doesn't sound pretty.",
  "he has done very well.",
  "that's pretty interesting to know.",
  "that would suck.",
  "don't you think it is too far?",
  "you are probably right about that.",
  "are you well paid?",
  "well, it's true.",
  "that's also interesting.",
  "i seldom play SPORTS_EVENT.",

  "no, sorry, we didn't.",
  "i think he might.",
  "i am not sure but they probably do not play in LOCATION.",

  "that is good",
  "in dc they even have children's FAC.",
  "yeah pretty neat.",
  "same OCCUPATION.",
  "that was always my favorite one.",
  "speaking of living on LOCATION.",

  "i think that was why.",
  "that is ridiculously fast!",
  "i really like that.",
  "hmmm.....i'm not sure.",
  "and they play rather energetically.",
  "ah i didnt hear about that.",
  "is it raining right now?",
  "it's not as good.",
  "ya that is shocking and sad.",
  "would it be full now?",
  "i would love to have a pet ANIMAL.",
  "that's terrific.",
  "i absolutely agree!",
  "they would kill each other.",
  "i wonder why they are surprised that it is popular here.",
  "not all of it.",
  "how much must i pay?",
  "do you have PRODUCT now?",
  "i feel they're dirty.",
  "he is definitely up there.",
  "we have to send it to LOCATION.",
  "i agree totally.",
  "that ’ s simple.",
  "to do it for so long.",
  "that would be wonderful.",
  "what do you usually do with them?",
  "we can be so critical of one another.",
  "well, that's reasonable.",
  "i feel like that after some FOOD.",
  "i certainly have.",
  "im with you there.",
  "it was ok.",
  "i already voted.",
  "LOCATION is beautiful.",
  "it's light enough, but the PRODUCT will get too hot after cooking.",

  "hey, young man!",
  "i do not know that.",
  "well, he indeed likes me.",
  "ok.let's go.",
  "it may have been random, but have you?",
  "okay, okay, i got it!",

  "i didn ’ t expect him to win.",
  "what! 86%?",
  "i'm gonna go listen to his album on PRODUCT now.",
  "oh that's cool...",
  "well i can't believe it.",
  "i think its a great SPORTS_VENUE.",
  "ok.but i'd like some cookies.",
  "i dont know why.",
  "yeah when you think about it it makes it ever sadder to what we are doing to this LOCATION",
  "well, how much are they?",
  "i do not own an PRODUCT.",
  "that would be good.",
  "it's just that you have to be patient and try to relax.",
  "i actually did!",
  "yes. have you ever played TYPE_OF_SPORT?",
  "i am going to invite other ORG.",
  "when did that happen?",
  "i do not know much about him.",
  "is that hard to get a PRODUCT?",
  "b.o.?",
  "she does and she does not look 50 at all!",
  "i think i would have probably bit him too.",
  "i doubt they let you smoke in the PRODUCT",
  "are you interested in the ORG in general?",
  "ahah i'm sure ORG would rather him never sing.",
  "i didn't know that either about them.",
  "yes and what's so good about the PRODUCT is how accessible it is.",
  "i think i'm going to go buy myself a PRODUCT.",
  "no. can't say that i have.",
  "yeah it seems like it.",
  "i'm not sure where it is.",
  "fine, bring us double.",
  "really impressive!",
  "oh, it's hard to narrow it down to just one.",
  "well, this is something new.",
  "yeah i just read that too.",
  "that is very interesting!",
  "what's tomorrow?",
  "i don't really listen to new MUSIC_GENRE much.",
  "that isn't good.",
  "what is it used for?",
  "not unexpected.",
  "i would have liked them to be there, but they couldn ’ t afford to fly out to see us, and we couldn't afford to fly out to see them, so they understood.",
  "he seems to be a hard workin' OCCUPATION...",
  "so do you subscribe to BUSINESS?",
  "there's been a few ORG.",
  "in the early LOCATION.",
  "it would be tough.",
  "i guess they would be motivated to perform.",
  "ewww!",
  "wonder how he got done so quick?",
  "do i have to fill up when i check in?",
  "that is so hard to believe.",
  "i've never egosurfed.",
  "is it popular ?",
  "no, they were really easy on him.",
  "it is the same here.",
  "hey, i know what that's like.",
  "yes, i think so, too.",
  "that is a light PRODUCT.",
  "unfortunately, not.",
  "i like the ORG as well.",
  "that i didn't know!",
  "yes it is sexist and it needs to go really",
  "you're going to make me rich by not paying me?",
  "do you have to comprehend when you speed PRODUCT?",
  "here is our PRODUCT.",
  "and where are they now?",
  "funny you should mention PRODUCT.",
  "that is so long i didn't know that was possible.",
  "that's good of them!",
  "they are ok.",
  "now that it is all over.",

  "that's ridiculous!",
  "i ’ ll be glad to help.",
  "that is not something i have never heard.",
  "how?",
  "is he talented and popular?",
  "PERSON probably does.",
  "i ' m afraid he didn ’ t leave one.",
  "she was 11.",
  "they usually do.",
  "yeah i think that is as well.",
  "if not.",
  "oh, you are too conservative.",
  "i didnt know that although its a great ORG so its not surprising.",
  "are you enjoying it there?",
  "he created something called the PRODUCT.",
  "and on another WORK_OF_ART.",
  "here are $ 40.",
  "she's not bad.",
  "all right, it's done.",
  "and even you are right.",
  "you would think it would, but it most likely won ’ t.",
  "that PRODUCT is very fun.",
  "i dont really have one.",
  "i just saw that too.",
  "that was also unusual.",
  "yes i have to wonder that also.",
  "it's always warm in september and october.",
  "no. are you serious?",
  "oh, how silly of me.",
  "i would have never have guessed that.",
  "apparently it isnt as popular as they think.",
  "who is ORG for queen?",
  "what does the BUSINESS mainly do?",
  "it should be coming soon.",
  "thats surprising.",
  "i need $ 300.",
  "yes i hope so.",
  "i would be curious myself to see who it was",
  "he has a EVENT to get reelected.",
  "strongly agree.",
  "yeah it's not for everybody.",
  "oh that's right.",
  "that must have been interesting.",
  "yes i heard about that!",
  "he said he was overrated.",
  "that's amazing but also concerning.",
  "oh, i understand.",
  "i don't think that you're done.",
  "i don't know who he is.",
  "i don't know about that.",
  "i think you can.",
  "i will definitely look into it!",
  "i think it helps that she was coached by PERSON though.",
  "yes, thursday would be fine.",
  "how would your present OCCUPATION describe you?",
  "same as well.",
  "it must be.",
  "where there is a will.",
  "i was really surprised when i heard that.",
  "that's my second favorite :)",
  "i guess they are more symbolic than practical.",
  "he is perfect for OCCUPATION.",
  "i wonder if they use it.",
  "are you planning on voting?",
  "well, it's probably nothing serious.",
  "how soon before this goes through?",
  "yes, i'm looking forward to that!",
  "that ’ s not too bad.",
  "i probably could not do it.",
  "oh right i read that.",
  "they'd be shocked for sure.",
  "yeah we do not hear much about other EVENT anyways",
  "the NATION are always trying to be different.",
  "like PRODUCT?",
  "i cannot even imagine.",
  "you guessed it correctly.",
  "hmm you wouldn't think that look at some of them.",
  "do you like ever chat online?",
  "you know..",
  "pretty impressive!",
  "you do the same.",
  "i was regularly use PRODUCT only.",
  "i thought he looked heavier than i'd ever seen him!",
  "he has an enormous PRODUCT?",
  "i know, it would be horrible if it rained and it was hot outside.",
  "how much do we owe you?",
  "oh i totally would.",
  "he's pretty good.",
  "i'll try all of those.",
  "did you vote EVENT?",
  "i did hear it was expensive.",
  "i'm sure he's fine.",
  "that ’ s just what i need.",
  "i don't like that one.",
  "well, thank you very much, i hope i can find it.",
  "i think he is very prosperous.",
  "there are only 9 OCCUPATION though.",
  "also.",
  "ya i like to buy PRODUCT from there.",
  "i liked LOCATION.",
  "how is this possible?",
  "and that they can't just believe what they want to believe when it doesn't hurt anyone.",
  "we're completely open on saturday.",
  "i bet they were worn out 24/7.",
  "i like both.",
  "yeah that's kind of weird.",
  "i'll bet you were hungry!",
  "it is on the LOCATION.",
  "well, that sounds just wonderful.",
  "apparently there is only $ 57 left in your PRODUCT.",
  "i think they do.",
  "they can't even agree amongst themselves.",
  "it really kind of does.",
  "oh, no, i'm fine.",
  "i really appreciate that.",
  "yes and they are only 2.7 PRODUCT wide",
  "but you might void your LAW!",
  "oh, shut up, will you?",
  "that is kind of depressing!",
  "i have not seen that.",
  "you too!",
  "let ’ s look at the BUSINESS.",
  "though they were ugly, they had great WORK_OF_ART.",
  "4 million PRODUCT wow.",
  "i would say so.",

  "we do agree!",
  "ahh that's definitely enough then.",
  "he used to be.",

  "do you need anything else?",
  "oh, no, i'm afraid not.",
  "i use it yeah.",
  "i'm curious as well.",
  "i am really interested in reading some of that it sounds so cool.",
  "i wonder how they figured that out.",
  "well luckily with these \"safely managed PRODUCT.\"",
  "hawaii?",
  "it certainly is.",
  "i think i've heard of him too.",
  "mmm... let me think.",
  "or toasting FOOD.",
  "yeah that is so nice.",
  "hard to tell.",
  "the ACADEMIC_DISCIPLINE of it is interesting.",
  "oh dang it.",

  "i wonder which SPORT_TEAM he plays for?",
  "is that more expensive?",
  "i'm curious too.",
  "no he is a complete WORK_OF_ART.",

  "i still have the 5s.",
  "yeah it is really amazing.",
  "but the PRODUCT has spread everywhere.",
  "can't say that i do.",
  "i see, but how do you pay for it?",
  "well, it's very convenient and very popular now.",
  "no, i will stay another day.my OCCUPATION will get over it.",
  "thats interesting...although i feel like they own everything",
  "oh that sounds really funny!",
  "he bought me an PRODUCT.",
  "i have not.",
  "you needn't worry about that.",
  "did you now they owned BUSINESS too?",
  "that is extreme.",
  "i would totally do that!!",
  "i have heard of that but i don't actually know what it is.",
  "i thought about going to my sister's.",
  "well it's interesting to me.",
  "oh, that ’ s right.",

  "how ’ s it going?",
  "did you ever use PRODUCT?",
  "he did and they are.",
  "i need to move some PRODUCT.",
  "oh wow. good for him if he enjoys that.",
  "you and me both lol.",
  "he seems like a pretty good OCCUPATION.",
  "ya i never played it.",
  "at least he was honest about it.",
  "is it on netflix?",
  "i wonder why they did that?",
  "which LOCATION should i apply to?",
  "i ’ m never coming back.",

  "hopefully they're still on there.",
  "i have to watch that one.",
  "that's hilarious.",
  "probably you ’ re right.",
  "i thought they were.",
  "i never tried.",
  "i think the same.",
  "thats really funny!",
  "does that work?",
  "he seemed ok.",
  "hmm.",
  "i sure will.",
  "ok, ok.i ’ m feeling a little dehydrated.",
  "i guess we'd have really burned and cold PRODUCT.",
  "i have not seen it but it was picked up at midseason.",
  "no, you can take it away now.",
  "i would like some FOOD.",
  "i'm sure they have.",
  "not my favorite",
  "i can't say that i've heard of the PRODUCT - what is it?",
  "friday at 6 pm. would be perfect.",
  "yes he must have been.",
  "i would appreciate it if you would do that for me.",
  "that's why i applied for this OCCUPATION.",
  "ive always wondered about that.",
  "10:00 am.when",
  "ya i still haven't used that PRODUCT.",
  "it is in LOCATION!",
  "how do you like this one?",
  "i cannot.",
  "yeah i was thinking about watching it.",
  "i ’ ll try, but what if she insists?",
  "i can't imagine them being related.",
  "no, there isn't.",
  "that is hysterical.",
  "now that is hilarious for sure!",
  "i am sorry, we do not accept LAW.",
  "a WORK_OF_ART dancer!",
  "not sure either.",
  "i guess not much lives down there.",
  "that would be bad for me.",
  "simple, it's fun.",
  "i think we should study that so we can live longer.",
  "oh, i forget.",
  "that might be.",
  "dad!",
  "i thought this was clever.",
  "and same with you.",
  "i would love to see mt. everest.",
  "i havent.",
  "would you tell her PERSON called?",

  "try and stand up.",
  "he probably did i'm sure.",
  "i really wish i hadn ’ t done it.",
  "i didn't why does he do that?",
  "i will think about it.",
  "but you agreed to go out with me at last.",
  "he has a silly nickname-",
  "well, actually, i am thinking about living off LOCATION.",
  "i think that might be partially intentional too.",
  "oh yes!",
  "ironically.",
  "that's ok.we'll contact you the moment we hear from home.",
  "so i've noticed.",
  "it's boring, right?",
  "yeah i remember that.",
  "why not buy the PRODUCT?",
  "i vaguely know something about that.",
  "oh, i think i should try to read one.",
  "im guessing he did.",
  "oh yeah....",
  "yeah well its been nice to chat.",
  "they recently relaunched it in digital PRODUCT.",
  "can you tell me how to improve myself?",
  "oh you should have!",
  "i dont personally no.",
  "i am shocked to hear that.",
  "relatively, once we're out of LOCATION, anyway.",
  "that's quite odd.",
  "ha i didn't know that.",
  "LANGUAGE is hard.",
  "i agree with those NORP 100% too.",
  "7",
  "it only gets crowded once it gets to la.",
  "i agree with that too.",
  "oh i never heard of that.",
  "i thought that was funny.",
  "oh really... why is that?",
  "i have one but never hooked it up.",
  "can i bring you some FOOD?",
  "that's innovative.",
  "yeah if i had to choose.",
  "it is ok.",
  "PRODUCT was so popular for awhile!",
  "it has to be so frustrating.",
  "they may be doing that.",
  "yes but it brings them all together and bonds them.",
  "i do it every once in a while.",
  "yes, the FOOD looks wonderful!",
  "the PRODUCT has changed so much!",
  "i thought mine would be too.",
  "that is interesting how close we are related to everything we encounter.",
  "where's the PRODUCT?",
  "i know right",
  "oh i'm sure it must have been exhausting.",
  "i used to watch.",
  "ok, settled then.",
  "i wonder what it was like to be married to PERSON.",
  "oh, he really should.",
  "would you like this to-go?",
  "i've always somehow felt it !",
  "then we'd better not go.",
  "no. why is it painted pink?",
  "ok that sounds about right.",
  "that's awesome they did that!",
  "i wonder who invented it.",
  "well, it's just that i think if you don't enjoy doing something any more, you should stop doing it.",
  "go and do it!",
  "yeah that's true he did.",
  "i think they are technically allowed to play.",
  "it sort of sounds not real to me.",
  "i was so scared when i saw the PRODUCT.",
  "well, it could be me too.",
  "it was 1975.",
  "i think that's what it means yes.",
  "i like some.",
  "i used to use BUSINESS.",
  "indeed, you're exactly right!",
  "i am sure we will.",
  "he certainly is.",
  "it has been nice chatting!",
  "i will move to LOCATION.",
  "well, then, how much do i owe you?",
  "well, i like collecting PRODUCT!",
  "very well.",
  "i like the PRODUCT.",
  "you're making me feel old now!",
  "they said that she passed faster than they thought she would but at least she did not have to suffer for too long.",
  "i certainly can try...",
  "i don't know what happened there.",
  "yeah i agree it does.",
  "does she?",
  "i did not know about that one.",
  "how long does it take to get to the BUSINESS?",
  "i wonder if he's going to retire from tv entirely.",
  "how do you propose to help him understand that?",
  "i will definitely look this PRODUCT up :)",
  "i will be!",
  "it is quite large.",
  "i am still young.",
  "they are just very intelligent i guess",
  "PERSON also does too !",
  "oh wow that's so cool.",
  "that's kind of unexpected.",
  "mostly LANGUAGE i imagine considering that is where they broadcast from.",
  "well, you'd better get some more warm PRODUCT.",
  "well at least you know now!",
  "i have heard of them but don't really know much about them.",
  "that is gonna be fun to watch.",
  "it is definitely one of them.",
  "are you a PERSON?",
  "i just think it is too spread out and not direct enough.",
  "apparently he peaked early though and never really became as great as he could be",
  "like in LOCATION.",
  "that made me laugh!",
  "from what i remember.",
  "sounds fun.",
  "yes they did it to help out ORG.",
  "not really :)",
  "i realize that, but i am not guilty.",
  "that is really cool.",
  "it certainly does bring us together.",
  "i like some MUSIC_GENRE.",
  "it's hard to believe that you like it.",
  "i never really thought about that.",
  "he is really talented.",
  "i have not seen that one",
  "yeah i do too.",
  "i like her.",
  "did you ever watch tv when it was only black and white?",
  "yeah that is sad as well.",
  "i understand, ms. PERSON.",
  "don't really know him well.",
  "that sounds just wonderful to us.",
  "yeah and they should.",
  "if they are well done.",
  "yes i wonder that as well.",
  "i think i know how you feel.",
  "oh, don't let that worry you.",
  "yes, it ’ s exciting.",
  "wow i didn't either.",
  "very unfair.",
  "how neat is that!",
  "most likely not.",
  "thats also really funny.",
  "yes it stands for BUSINESS.",
  "press the done PRODUCT.",
  "that is remarkable.",
  "hi!",
  "oh i did not know that.",
  "yeah thank you as well.",
  "i would do that too.",
  "yes, that's perfect.",
  "ok.then tell me what else you know.",
  "it's 100 % PRODUCT.",
  "yep i agree.",
  "i have never been.",
  "well thank you.",
  "i think we'll buy this PRODUCT.",
  "gosh.",
  "no never heard of it either probably confusing to watch",
  "now let me show you around.",
  "i would have liked to hear that actually.",
  "i though it was earlier.",
  "she also helped invent the PRODUCT.",
  "i wonder if ORG knew about it.",
  "it is creepy.",
  "maybe it was made before he decided to only project WORK_OF_ART.",
  "i guess :)",
  "i cant say as i do.",
  "oh, that's terrible.",
  "let's just hope my OCCUPATION agrees.",
  "it ’ s too old.",
  "i think most do.",
  "that to me is actually more interesting and cool!",
  "sure, but how?",
  "i wonder how they do that as if we know.",
  "not too sure what LANGUAGE he spoke.",
  "that's long leave.",
  "did you see that in NATION.",
  "yeah that is pretty amazing.",
  "that is quite short.",
  "i do remember them.",
  "i have not heard of that.",
  "when have you been most motivated?",
  "our ORG is a little different.",
  "i am not exactly sure.",
  "ha ha i am right there with you.",
  "it seems like it was if i remember right.",
  "the more i read it more impressed by him.",
  "it doesn't surprise me too much.",
  "who ’ s peter?",
  "he was taking PRODUCT to make him stronger and faster.",
  "they really are a large WORK_OF_ART.",
  "sure sounds like he will.",
  "not unless you want the LOCATION.",
  "it is surprising.",
  "no, but i can learn.",
  "wow, that's something new.",
  "ya that is funny that he was so threatening they had to do that.",
  "they're really running you into the LOCATION.",
  "i will bring the WORK_OF_ART.",
  "born in 1984.",
  "altogether, it's going to be $ 12.15.",
  "it's crazy how long ago that was.",
  "she's very funny.",
  "would he have done well on another SPORT_TEAM?",
  "yeah. hopefully.",
  "yes i like listen to the PRODUCT too-",
  "oh now i remember.",
  "not sure i know of him.",
  "it is right.",
  "that is kind of funny i wonder if it is on PRODUCT?",
  "i drive one.",
  "yes, that can be done here.",
  "do you like the BUSINESS now ?",
  "are they expensive though?",
  "what was LOCATION",
  "no i never knew that.",
  "well, we can do nothing about it.",
  "do you have any favorite WORK_OF_ART?",
  "ya i don't usually see that.",
  "yes, it is much earlier than past EVENT.",
  "it seems kind of random i agree.",
  "that would be interesting to learn.",
  "very cool and good for her.",
  "i have never been to a LOCATION before.",
  "they also had good FOOD.",
  "that would be neat.",
  "i think he was probably too handsome for them.",
  "what do you mean it has twin FAC?",
  "indeed he was!",
  "very peaceful i'm sure!",
  "it ’ s all NORP.",
  "oh that sounds good.",
  "i'm very old-fashioned.",
  "that's so embarrassing.",
  "well that is really cool.",
  "what do you like about him?",
  "i know exactly what you mean.",
  "i used to love that ORG.",
  "it's been good talking to you.",
  "to get back to LOCATION by 8",
  "no. never heard of it i'm afraid.",
  "that's too bad, but the FAC will be okay.",
  "yes, pretty well.",
  "that's cute.",
  "you are so not here!",
  "oh, i'll try to catch it.",
  "i know it does.",
  "do i have to pay to use the PRODUCT?",
  "do i need to pay anything?",
  "that's strange...",
  "it doesn't seem to be so easy.",
  "i have no listened to them .",
  "everything was okay when it started, but the MUSIC_GENRE made me drowsy.",
  "i think i was aware of that.",
  "yes he was good at impersonating OCCUPATION",
  "and if i do become injured.",
  "the ai would break away and leave this LOCATION.",
  "yes but in the u it did not last.",
  "you don't have to know.",
  "oh yeah",
  "it has been so nice speaking with you.",
  "yeah ORG are all about it.",
  "ah interesting that could be.",
  "here, try this PRODUCT.",
  "that does seem excessive.",
  "there it is.",
  "they started in 1919!",
  "oh yes, how's she getting on?",
  "but why do you choose TYPE_OF_SPORT at first?",
  "that ’ s really cool.",
  "i can take it then.",
  "that seems doable!",
  "could you tell me why you want to quit?",
  "oh yum!",
  "how about PERSON.",
  "i don't really know for sure yet.",
  "1975",
  "i use it for that too",
  "do you think he can do well?",
  "where do we get off at?",
  "yes, i think i am quite proficient in both written and spoken LANGUAGE.",
  "it seems so simple.",
  "i should start exercising more.",
  "they might realize it's something special.",
  "that seems weird.",
  "ok, i'll do them.",
  "that is guaranteed.",
  "i'd like it to look simple, neat and relaxing.",
  "wow she must have been really good at it then.",
  "no. please tell me!",
  "ok, that's fine.",
  "i like PERSON",
  "i mean i like ORG as much as the next.",
  "she was born on december 13 1989.",
  "i wonder how they can do that.",
  "it kept me awake.",
  "i might be able to help...",
  "that ’ s easy.",
  "no, i am ok, really.",
  "well, i'm really surprised.",
  "i find it hard to picture them playing at all to be honest!",
  "take it easy!",
  "ha that iss interesting.",
  "sounds persuasive.",
  "i didn't know that they did that.",
  "no. who were they?",
  "don't really care if LOCATION pays for it.",
  "then we have LOCATION.",
  "when will i be able to do that?",
  "how many different OCCUPATION are there?",
  "doing what?",
  "big time !",
  "that sounds like an interesting PRODUCT.",
  "yeah i would have assumed it would have been TYPE_OF_SPORT.",
  "that's so fast.",
  "it would definitely be picked up on BUSINESS.",
  "do you follow the BUSINESS?",
  "yes, i think i will do something new.",
  "i worked in BUSINESS.",
  "and eat too much.",
  "was it worth it ?",
  "that's pretty impressive!",
  "i wish i still had mine.",
  "yeah i agree with you i bet it was.",
  "yeah you're probably right.",
  "i bet he would.",
  "yeah maybe he's a good OCCUPATION.",
  "i am not sure either.",
  "hahaha yeah!",
  "what NORP?",
  "it is serious.",
  "i bet they have to use a PRODUCT for that.",
  "they are synonyms.",
  "wow. good for them.",
  "ok.let me see.",
  "well, there is that, yes.",
  "agreed and yet.",
  "i wonder if there is a PRODUCT of all the tv shows.",
  "ah... let's just climb.",
  "maybe that could work.",
  "yeah he was the bad OCCUPATION.",
  "what is FOOD then?",
  "i think he was a fanatic NORP.",
  "it's a light blue PRODUCT.",
  "i don't think he did to be honest.",
  "i may have when i was little.",
  "if i were to bike around here i think i would need a PRODUCT with me to keep me safe.",
  "how much does it cost?",
  "i can't say.",
  "i wonder why that is illegal.",
  "i really like where i ’ m at now.",
  "no, not now.",
  "i just can't help it.",
  "i'm just going to let you go.",
  "maybe the PRODUCT is going bad.",
  "the babe?",
  "oh, that's just too bad.",
  "what do you think about the OCCUPATION?",
  "four in hundred, one in ten, please.",
  "i bet that you wish you hadn't done that.",
  "that was probably crazy with opposing NORP.",
  "i'd walk...",
  "yes now you have to pay for it.",
  "i think they're still good.",
  "yep that seems really scary to me.",
  "i like to read .",
  "i do like them do you?",
  "i have and its pretty good.",
  "i said that you are supposed to have an EVENT.",
  "no i haven't read anything that old.",
  "but how can you stop them.",
  "so long ago i don't even remember.",
  "that is also crazy.",
  "it was probably longer than that.",
  "i do who doesn't if you can afford it.",
  "that is actually pretty cool.",
  "it is crazy to think that we had to shutdown the ORG for that.",
  "yeah they both did very well",
  "he was asked why he would endorse a POLITICAL_PARTY.",
  "it definitely should!",
  "yeah he was smart.",
  "must have been a smart OCCUPATION.",
  "i like that one.",
  "i did see that!",
  "now yes.",
  "that is very nice of you.",
  "that would be a WORK_OF_ART nowadays.",
  "well he probably got paid though.",
  "i know what you are talking about.",
  "i also have a cheap PRODUCT and think that it does just fine.",
  "yeah that's good.",
  "how nice of you to say so.",
  "unfortunately, sir, you'll have to pay the $ 2, whether you like it or not.",
  "smart.",
  "yes he must be proud of that.",
  "that is pretty awesome!",
  "ok.go ahead.",
  "i admire you.",
  "it is amazing and we just keep getting more advanced with it.",
  "you can cash them here, how much do you want to cash?",
  "yes, there is one behind our FAC.",
  "you look great, you are absolutely glowing.",
  "no i didnt.",
  "that's pretty crazy for sure.",
  "oh, excellent.",
  "he must have wondered why his PERSON didn't do anything with them.",
  "right i like TYPE_OF_SPORT",
  "that is very kind of you to offer to do that.",
  "you go figure it out yourself.",
  "i used to play it but not anymore.",
  "well, that sounds good, i have never lived in a BUSINESS.",
  "i would hope so.",
  "i'm going to register right now.",
  "what was that like?",
  "it's 7.2 % , fixed-rate loan.",
  "i could only imagine how exciting that was.",
  "most certainly not.",
  "i tell you.",
  "CHEMICAL_ELEMENT?",
  "yeah that is shocking.",
  "h",
  "it is sadly true.",
  "i probably would not.",
  "i am good too.",
  "well i could see why they wouldn't buy it.",
  "when i think of TYPE_OF_SPORT.",
  "oh, no PRODUCT?",
  "no, i thought i would take it later.",
  "it was my favorite.",
  "it looks like i might have convinced you to go to LOCATION!",
  "oh, that's funny!",
  "i didn't care for it.",
  "338.000 from 2017.",
  "well, that all depends on how much you want to invest.",
  "yeah and how fast it is going.",
  "you pay when you pick them up.",
  "was nice talking to you.",
  "i don't watch tv that much any more.",
  "i can see him.",
  "that was pretty fun .",
  "that's pretty cool to think about.",
  "i guess LOCATION.",
  "i'll be expecting you, then.",
  "that's what i meant.",
  "you should be there some EVENT.",
  "terrible!",
  "but you're right.",
  "is that serious?",
  "interesting isn't it.",
  "i did not but that's pretty upsetting.",
  "i read that somewhere as well.",
  "yes, can you please let him know i called and ask him to call me back as soon as he can?",
  "i don't know either.",
  "but remember, be careful when you ride a PRODUCT.",
  "yeah i dont really see it happening.",
  "i can believe it.",
  "isn't that surprising?",
  "ok yes.",
  "i am of some of it.",
  "i've also been busy.",
  "it ’ s very simple.",
  "i had heard about that.",
  "i don't know but they used it back in WORK_OF_ART.",
  "yeah they were awesome.",
  "i bet you had to drag him away.",
  "didn ’ t anyone stop them?",
  "but you're busy, aren't you?",
  "must be doing alright for himself.",
  "you ’ re not nervous?",
  "i agree it's scary too.",
  "no, it is a fortnightly.",
  "ha.ha.ha",
  "no, not yet, but someone ’ s going to have to.",
  "that's cute...",
  "yeah, that's it.",
  "i think i may have heard that before.",
  "do you mean you want to sell up your BUSINESS of your own?",
  "she was speaking his LANGUAGE!",
  "i wonder if that worked!",
  "well that's great!",
  "i would say no.",
  "t a x i, please.",
  "see you on thursday, then.",
  "can i have one each?",
  "no, we haven't.",
  "it is a strange LOCATION.",
  "i don't think i've ever dipped into that one.",
  "oh, you didn ’ t have to...",
  "hmm, i must be getting absent-minded.",
  "i did not know it either until now.",
  "he does seem arrogant.",
  "i like him too.",
  "or the ORG.",
  "how many PRODUCT do you have?",
  "no. PERSON has been around for a while.",
  "i'll never hurt you ; i'll never lie.",
  "it might be possible.",
  "i wonder how many he smashed?!",
  "and you.",
  "well i had the follow up PRODUCT.",
  "it would have been for sure.",
  "yeah pretty fair.",
  "WORK_OF_ART is awesome.",
  "are you able to operate the PRODUCT?",
  "not as often as i used to.",
  "oh that is very nice!!",
  "i listen sometimes.",
  "when will you find out?",
  "that was weird.",
  "yes. would seem strange without him.",
  "that's really admirable.",
  "now come on... that's just crazy!!!",
  "and apparently as good as he was.",
  "hey if she can make that much i dont blame her for taking it.",
  "i am not sure about that",
  "they really are a great BUSINESS.",
  "i see thats too bad.",
  "i think it is interesting how some considered their ACADEMIC_DISCIPLINE important.",
  "no i didn't know that either.",
  "oh yeah i could see that.",
  "that is pretty creepy!",
  "well, here's 3,000 yuan.",
  "i also here OCCUPATION are.",
  "that's ok.but you'd better take an additional course in some LANGUAGE schools.",
  "my PRODUCT is 627-555-1234.",
  "i have heard too.",
  "that",
  "yeah that would be amazing to see.",
  "wow that is very well put.",
  "i bet it turns into a BUSINESS essentially when that happens!",
  "thats by BUSINESS right?",
  "if you do not believe.",
  "that ’ s unbelievable.",
  "who's in it?",
  "haha classic!",
  "this seems odd.",
  "you WORK_OF_ART!",
  "i dont think so but thats interesting.",
  "i couldn't agree with you.",
  "ya it is in ACADEMIC_DISCIPLINE apparently",
  "he was a good OCCUPATION and very smart.",
  "yeah and he only made $7500 from it",
  "that's a nice round WORK_OF_ART to deal with!",
  "go eagles!",
  "but that doesn't stop me from drinking.",
  "he is a good one.",
  "oh nice that is really cool.",
  "i think i got confused.",
  "that's pretty messed up.",
  "adios.",
  "they said it is centrally controlled.",
  "that is odd.",
  "oh, you ’ re not listening to me.",
  "i guess so.",
  "how do i do that?",
  "i do not collect.",
  "yeah i will have to check it out.",
  "same here .",
  "i wonder how they do that so we can help more .",
  "i wonder what's considered more dominant though.",
  "yeah thats what i was wondering.",
  "have you ever used a rotary PRODUCT.",
  "so much we don't know or understand.",
  "yeah i'm not 100% sure on that.",
  "yeah i heard that as well.",
  "yes i wonder how that turned out for them.",
  "i wonder how many OCCUPATION that's been?",
  "i have not!",
  "the same for me.",
  "sounds familiar but i didn't go see it.",
  "that would be really cool to get him to play it.",
  "i'm kind of glad they didn't.",
  "that ’ s",
  "do you love me?",
  "this FOOD's very good.",
  "i do like some TYPE_OF_SPORT.",
  "if you go to LOCATION.",
  "call the ORG.",
  "i've read that they grow back stronger after they get broken.",
  "not bad.",
  "do you have anything to declare?",
  "that is nice to be that young.",
  "i did not know about that.",
  "well i prefer MUSIC_GENRE.",
  "i was just thinking about that!",
  "you know, red FOOD is proved unnatural.",
  "yes, but why should you want to do that?",
  "i understand.. it seems it would be a little crazy but also not something i'd personally enjoy.",
  "yeah i find that strange considering they are so isolated",
  "it ’ s mild.",
  "i do as well.",
  "no. why?",
  "oh, he is all right.",
  "that was great for him to do.",
  "that's pretty surprising since he's got such an elaborate WORK_OF_ART.",
  "i'm more into WORK_OF_ART.",
  "and some of it ended up in modern NORP.",
  "that was either a super fun PRODUCT to watch or it eventually got very boring.",
  "thinking back on it.",
  "as i said, it is possible, but it would be much more expensive.",
  "i would rather just not be nominated",
  "are they creepy?",
  "ha that's too bad",
  "you are probably right there.",
  "yeah that is convenient.",
  "what did he do?",
  "ok, it won't happen again.",
  "you're correct!!!",
  "i am so happy that she's doing okay.",
  "what do you think about BUSINESS?",
  "i had the first two.",
  "ok.i know what to do now.",
  "what else will you be needing?",
  "we should come here more often.",
  "i actually did not know that!",
  "oh wow i'll have to check that out.",
  "very sexist i must say.",
  "i think just the LOCATION",
  "i don't think i'm going to dream about anything.",
  "that's crazy...",
  "no. didn't see that one either.",
  "hes amazing.",
  "i have actually not.",
  "seems odd to sue them though.",
  "what would you like to ask me?",
  "i didn't know that what is the ORG called?",
  "what are you so ticked off about?",
  "i agree PRODUCT are great.",
  "i think he can.",
  "yeah i guess we all have different NORP.",
  "i couldn't imagine that.",
  "with SPORT_TEAM.",
  "that must have been a really bad EVENT.",
  "it sounds familiar.",
  "oh wow that's really cool.",
  "as far as astronomical ACADEMIC_DISCIPLINE is concerned.",
  "i can ’ t help that.",
  "yeah it sure must have been.",
  "they have?",
  "you would have thought that is what it was for!",
  "really i would have thought WORK_OF_ART would have been!",
  "yes, but i got angry with him too quickly.",
  "i ’ m ready looking forward to it.",
  "is it ready to be picked up?",
  "what are they?",
  "i could not agree with you more.",
  "i can only speculate.",
  "do you believe that the OCCUPATION lied?",
  "he was actually quite handsome.",
  "but still.",
  "that would be cool and expensive to go to i bet.",
  "i felt embarrased.",
  "i already know all of them.",
  "i do like listening to the PRODUCT.",
  "i never did understand why they have to destroy PRODUCT.",
  "it's really sad how petty or troubled of a OCCUPATION you have to be to do it too.",
  "there are PRODUCT everywhere.",
  "i thought i did.",
  "i would never want to travel the whole LOCATION then i think.",
  "it is indeed eerie.",
  "aw that is kind of sweet.",
  "yuck!",
  "i absolutely love it.",
  "actually all you have to do is feed it plastic PRODUCT",
  "i don't watch much.",
  "i'm behind to.",
  "wow i wonder what he thought when he found out.",
  "it is very interesting to know it.",
  "it says keep off the LOCATION!",
  "that sounds easy enough.",
  "they are great for in the PRODUCT too.",
  "they don't really fit you right.",
  "i like him actually.",
  "i had heard that it burned FOOD.",
  "yes, so you still remember, ah.",
  "i ’ ll do it for you.",
  "i like a FOOD please.",
  "i'll be back as soon as possible.",
  "keeping it retro!",
  "which of those two is best?",
  "no, that gets it for now, thank you.",
  "that's pretty amazing.",
  "sayonara!",
  "okay, miss.",
  "yes. TYPE_OF_SPORT is cool.",
  "what about the BUSINESS?",
  "yes i do drive.",
  "yeah thats crazy to think about.",
  "next june.",
  "i guess its especially fitting then.",
  "i don't think they will.",
  "yeah i didn't know that.",
  "does the vp do nothing?",
  "how long do you expect her to live?",
  "just go!",
  "she was a very controversial OCCUPATION.",
  "an PRODUCT.",
  "no i haven't read that one either.",
  "they don't.",
  "some of them are good.",
  "that would be awesome.",
  "i always think.",
  "yep.pretty fascinating",
  "i wonder if he ever went to LOCATION.",
  "not just working ACADEMIC_DISCIPLINE.",
  "that he could.",
  "yes i do have an BUSINESS.",
  "yes it seems very rare.",
  "yeah pretty small considering what is out there",
  "i own some!",
  "i have never heard of that!",
  "oh, yes, i know the one.",
  "they really shouldn't!",
  "i agree that i think it would be unlikely especially since the SPORTS_LEAGUE has been around since 1920.",
  "it doesn't seem like too much if you think of it like a monthly PRODUCT.",
  "really, that ’ s cool.",
  "it sure is full with FOOD i agree with you there.",
  "yeah. seems kind of odd to be honest.",
  "well, that's great.",
  "with WORK_OF_ART from the deep?",
  "we can only hope.",
  "that's actually fairly recent i think.",
  "that's very convenient.",
  "oh, this is nice and light.",
  "ok, i see",
  "yes, that's a current-all-in-one PRODUCT.",
  "i enjoy TYPE_OF_SPORT as well.",
  "that's awesome and nice of him to do.",
  "i didn't know you smoked.",
  "no i don't listen to him either.",
  "that would be very cool to watch.",
  "i wonder if carjacking is that common there!",
  "that is even better!",
  "SPORT_TEAM now",
  "well, could you change them too?",
  "ya he proved them wrong.",
  "i hadn't really watch TYPE_OF_SPORT until i started dating my ex.",
  "have you learned any other foreign LANGUAGE?",
  "i call it tv or BUSINESS.",
  "i'm good at this.",
  "it's not too bad, but it's pretty cold here too.",
  "i think i read somewhere recently where he is the richest OCCUPATION ever.",
  "i know i think they should.",
  "i like situational WORK_OF_ART the best.",
  "i've never heard that before-",
  "yes i enjoy reading but not as much as i should!",
  "yes you're right.",
  "i went to a small private LOCATION.",
  "that would be pretty dangerous.",
  "i don't think i ever want to.",
  "i have 2.",
  "be confident, and never give up.",
  "a-what?",
  "wow that could get expensive.",
  "i have to work this tuesday.",
  "oh no!  stuck like injured?",
  "yeah i didn't know that either!",
  "that's what i should do.",
  "that ’ s wonderful.",
  "yes, it helps me",
  "i think they have 3g PRODUCT.",
  "a cool three million dollars!",
  "you definitely should learn.",
  "very well, i'll take these two.",
  "quite complicated indeed.",
  "they are very annoying.",
  "i haven't been yet.",
  "anything to get me up and running.",
  "oh ok i'll have to check it out.",
  "fine, thank you for coming.",
  "i know what you mean there.",
  "yeah i wonder why he did that?",
  "yes, i ’ m sorry.",
  "i bet he will!!",
  "i think he wasnt allergic at first.",
  "super mario bros",
  "ok yes i do like WORK_OF_ART.",
  "oh thats great.",
  "what PRODUCT is she?",
  "FOOD are so tasty.",
  "is it the same in LOCATION?",
  "it was really an exciting EVENT.",
  "i want this WORK_OF_ART registered.",
  "i wonder too.",
  "he should've stashed some in his PRODUCT.",
  "jefferson?",
  "that's very sad!",
  "that's kind of boring.",
  "i had never heard that.",
  "ok, would you like some FOOD as well?",
  "yes, i do, very much.",
  "yeah i did read about him.",
  "what ACADEMIC_DISCIPLINE are you studying?",
  "yeah that may work for her.",
  "i had heard something about that.",
  "signing off.",
  "it absolutely is.",
  "i know some like.",
  "do you think he'd ever smash a PRODUCT?",
  "PRODUCT is my favorite too.",
  "that is totally crazy.",
  "i have never had to teach my pet ANIMAL to point.",
  "i guess its because they have so many ANIMAL.",
  "i didnt know about that!",
  "i love the ORG as well.",
  "that's crazy - i would have never guessed that either!",
  "i guess they really don't like PERSON?",
  "not yet, but it soon will be.",
  "oh, they're both so beautiful.",
  "i do like to but don't get to as much as i would like to.",
  "i think he's great.",
  "yeah tell me about it.",
  "that was quite a while ago.",
  "i've paid for it.",
  "i realized what i typed after i sent it.",
  "yeah...thats what i was thinking of.",
  "oh not at all.",
  "yes the PRODUCT is very new",
  "yeah seems like it's been around forever.",
  "yeah i read about that somewhere.",
  "avoiding mixing FOOD seems very extreme.",
  "it's crazy how popular MUSIC_GENRE is.",
  "he ’ s huge!",
  "to where exactly?",
  "it sounds bogus.",
  "i do watch the SPORTS_EVENT.",
  "that is not much.",
  "so what do you think about our OCCUPATION.",
  "at 8 am.",
  "do you think they will succeed ?",
  "it was broadcast.",
  "i've been reading up here recently.",
  "yeah that sounds pretty cool.",
  "that's thoughtful of you.",
  "ouch, that sounds bad.",
  "whatever that means.",
  "sounds rough.",
  "yeah i do not even know what it looks like but it sounds scary",
  "i was really surprised by that.",
  "i'll hold you to that.",
  "i've been to LOCATION before.",
  "peter.",
  "i really didn't like any of it and thought it was odd and uncomfortable.",
  "that would be different.",
  "did you ever watch PERSON",
  "oh interesting you may be right.",
  "i am afraid that i might not be doing all that well.",
  "yes, certainly.",
  "that is really fast.",
  "i'll buy it for $ 2000.",
  "yes i guess so...",
  "that sounds a little offensive.",
  "i'd imagine it was.",
  "glad you asked me to join you.",
  "and a LOCATION that expands tremendously.",
  "made the SPORTS_SEASON but did nothing spectacular there.",
  "the TYPE_OF_SPORT is popular here.",
  "i quite agree with you.",
  "is that by PERSON as well.",
  "absolutely i couldn't agree more.",
  "are you sure you want to go?",
  "are they urgent, please?",
  "i'm not sure what grounds you can jail them.",
  "i agree they should change it.",
  "do i have to focus it?",
  "i've tried it.",
  "oh there is one.",
  "i mean PRODUCT.",
  "i don't blame you if you do!",
  "you sound smart as well.",
  "that is not for a while.",
  "let's hurry.",
  "what should i bring with me?",
  "that's wild.",
  "somewhat.",
  "i can live with that too.",
  "i wonder how that was measured.",
  "it doesn't cost anything.",
  "it's smashed in.",
  "i did see that and didn't realize that.",
  "i am curious about it and looking forward to seeing how it goes.",
  "i'm glad i did too.",
  "lean movie?",
  "have to....",
  "i didnt know that about him.",
  "you mean we can't just buy PRODUCT already made?",
  "what time?",
  "so do i.  there's a theory that there's only one electron in the universe.",
  "yeah i guess they are super busy after all.",
  "that makes me feel better.",
  "um... we never were.",
  "i don't understand what took so long to figure that out.",
  "can you describe for me, where you were sitting?",
  "i actually think that's incorrect.",
  "more than i should.",
  "that is misleading.",
  "i am ok.",
  "you mean used PRODUCT?",
  "i sometimes watch TYPE_OF_SPORT.",
  "that;s cool.",
  "i'd like it if they just weren't copyrighted.",
  "in 1930.",
  "so-so.",
  "yep you're right about that.",
  "it surprises me i have to admit.",
  "i've been there.",
  "it's not serious.",
  "yes, actually it ’ s my second EVENT.",
  "i would listen to that.",
  "that's right he was.",
  "are you really immortal though?",
  "i thought you didn't talk to them much.",
  "that must have sucked for them.",
  "that is very nice of them.",
  "would you mind telling me how old you are?",
  "do you have the newest PRODUCT as soon as they come out with a new one?",
  "do you know if it's am or fm?",
  "i actually want to try that.",
  "i couldn ’",
  "if i ever go ill have to check those out.",
  "i like it as well.",
  "i bet that was painful to watch!",
  "no, i left home at 6:30 as usual.",
  "i don't think i ever heard of it before now.",
  "yeah like TYPE_OF_SPORT maybe.",
  "i would probably buy another PRODUCT if it was not so expensive now.",
  "i would have thought it was from earlier than that.",
  "well, it looks like you have.",
  "i agree he is very lucky.",
  "he is a smart OCCUPATION.",
  "political?",
  "i think i'm about the same.",
  "that means you don ’ t like them.",
  "well it was great talking to you!",
  "what will your major be?",
  "well, wish him a happy EVENT for me.",
  "i watch them on tv.",
  "yeah i heard about that.",

  "i bet it does.",
  "it's very fascinating.",
  "hahaha nice!",
  "it is so useful.",
  "totally!",
  "yes. same with PERSON.",
  "bush jr.",
  "i didn't know that anyone had accomplished that.",
  "oh... don't remember that one...",
  "i like playing too.",
  "oh, dear.",
  "if it doesn't have PRODUCT.",
  "it doesnt i agree.",
  "i wonder how he stacks up against ORG.",
  "i still have yet to see one but i want to!",
  "i wonder if that means she actually comprehended those 4.700 words.",
  "i own a PRODUCT.",
  "well sometimes i just default on the PRODUCT.",
  "i sometimes listen.",
  "WORK_OF_ART are my favorite.",
  "i did a b.a. in ACADEMIC_DISCIPLINE.",
  "i am also 8 yr.",
  "that sounds very nice.",
  "yeah it is very fast paced.",
  "i am not very knowledgeable about TYPE_OF_SPORT.",
  "well, there are only two LOCATION open.",
  "i started out with the original PRODUCT myself.",
  "who do i talk to if i want i to see some of them?",
  "yeah it is odd.",
  "i figure they worry.",
  "do you know how they are able to be so realistic?",
  "she is so hilarious.",
  "i pray for it too.",
  "or WORK_OF_ART.",
  "i  do.",
  "no!!",
  "yeah i think that as well.",
  "if nothing else.",
  "i think we know now how it turned out.",
  "i was quite young then.",
  "yes it is still very heavy",
  "yep he seems very smart.",
  "and WORK_OF_ART.",
  "is say fl.",
  "it is so big.",
  "ok, ok.enough already.",
  "that's insane...",
  "someone probably did and sued them.",
  "ok.i'd like to say that i've really enjoyed working with you.",
  "hmmm did they really have to fine him though.",
  "my goodness!",
  "PRODUCT can be made of anything.",
  "i've used a PRODUCT.",
  "it probably compares worse.",
  "i don't get that one... what do you mean ?",
  "i don't think it is silly i definitely caught that as well.",
  "i washed my PRODUCT instead.",
  "that that seems very dumb.",
  "i think i am registered but have never uploaded anything.",
  "PRODUCT online is so much easier too.",
  "thats not too surprising.",
  "sure, madam.",
  "i guess i never thought about that before.",
  "yeah i think that is very interesting.",
  "it says noclue.",
  "can you speak any other LANGUAGE?",
  "i see, that's what i will order.",
  "they're not cheap, but neither is their PRODUCT.",
  "not in modern TYPE_OF_SPORT.",
  "wow interesting!",
  "where shall we go now?",
  "hey that is very true as well.",
  "and now he's made $440 million altogether - so far.",
  "it most likely will.",
  "ok.let's go and see.",
  "i used to have several growing up.",
  "follow me, please.",
  "i wonder if PERSON ever got to see it?",
  "they actually claim that?",
  "that's not enough.",
  "yeah thats correct.",
  "where?",
  "he should be.",
  "yes, much better.",
  "i dont see the WORK_OF_ART.",
  "it would be very cool to see PERSON.",
  "i did read that somewhere.",
  "i wonder how they did that.",
  "i don't really know much about the MUSIC_GENRE.",
  "not really, but i like watching.",
  "did you have anything to declare?",
  "i hope you feel better.",
  "i'm glad you say so, you dance beautifully too.",
  "that's thinking ahead...",
  "i wish they had.",
  "yes, thank you very much.",
  "i haven't been to one before.",
  "i liked the first three of them.",
  "maybe we can try shopping on BUSINESS.",
  "they had to have been crushed.",
  "i wouldn't be surprised either.",
  "yeah. not sure which one though.",
  "i wonder how many PRODUCT he went through.",
  "it is hard to say.",
  "no, it just won't work.",
  "i like him he's hilarious however he has stated that he does not do WORK_OF_ART anymore.",
  "yeah there are definitely some unique OCCUPATION out there!",
  "no, no, i'm just thinking of some FOOD.",
  "that's very odd.",
  "yes i did know that",
  "yep that's interesting.",
  "no, you have to pay it by yourself.",
  "for sure it has grown.",
  "50!",
  "this is so true.",
  "that makes me happy i didn't go there.",
  "i always am.",
  "that's ok.how can my salary be improved?",
  "as much as possible.",
  "yeah they stopped making it in 2003.",
  "yeah i gyess they are.",
  "that's true.",
  "sounds interesting.",
  "yes, i sure can.",
  "i'm surprised the PRODUCT wasn't discontinued until 2003.",
  "yeah it is a good PRODUCT.",
  "i would have never of guessed a replica FAC down there.",
  "i would think after he retires he would become a qb OCCUPATION or something.",
  "ha-ha!",
  "i don't like it at all.",
  "the OCCUPATION of zimbabwe!",
  "you don ’ t have to explain.",
  "then what should i do?",
  "yeah we could move to LOCATION.",
  "i did actually",
  "back then must have been so much different in general.",
  "really going to miss you.",
  "i'm not sure on that.",
  "i have to agree with him.",
  "i have been to LOCATION!!",
  "he was good but not enough.",
  "it sounds really challenging though!",
  "yeah i think i have read that.",
  "that he has.",
  "thank you for joining the ORG ; we look forward to serving you.",
  "you didn't read their PRODUCT or anything, did you?",
  "i never knew what it was until i just read about it.",
  "maybe he was just good at racing no matter real or in WORK_OF_ART?",
  "that seems crazy.",
  "oh i'm sure he did.",
  "i have heard of it yes.",
  "no i can't say that i travel too much.",
  "i knew it quite recently.",
  "no, not that long.",
  "makes for an entertaining PRODUCT to watch.",
  "that is still fun!",
  "that scares me!",
  "i think PRODUCT is everywhere.",
  "i doubt he can get it back.",
  "those are good!",
  "it might be good to you.",
  "seems like they didn't brainstorm their BUSINESS name too much.",
  "yes maybe he was so happy that he wanted to do something to commemorate that EVENT.",
  "yeah that is pretty scary.",
  "wow... that is cool!",
  "i like to think about everything we don't know.",
  "it was.",
  "yeah i think i read that somewhere as well.",
  "well, if everybody jumped off a FAC, would you jump too?",
  "i think that the PRODUCT should serve us.",
  "that could be interesting.",
  "i have heard a little about them.",
  "how can i ORG it?",
  "i would have to say the SPORTS_EVENT.",
  "we will need to know who will be driving the PRODUCT.",
  "that is neat.",
  "we could just drive.",
  "i feel like that has been around longer than 2000.",
  "oh yeah,",
  "well, i ’ m still not sure what you ’ re asking me.",
  "hmmm...",
  "i dont listen to anything on PRODUCT actually.",
  "i'm sure he used that for WORK_OF_ART to get to where he is now.",
  "no that is kind of crazy.",
  "i know he was recently injured actually.",
  "is there any PRODUCT in it?",
  "i think he was choosen by PERSON.",
  "that sounds awesome!",
  "now that i can agree to.",
  "hopefully.",
  "i probably wasn't allowed to watch it until the late 90's.",
  "they should.",
  "yeah that's a little unsettling.",
  "yes that seems very wasteful.",
  "oh, i see, that's the PRODUCT of 12 x 18cm.",
  "i think they are a little different.",
  "i don't believe WORK_OF_ART.",
  "she did??",
  "more inventive that i'd ever be.",
  "i wonder if they left it sitting around too long before they served it.",
  "i'm sorry that you don't like it.",
  "very little of it.",
  "i think it is just the most popular FOOD you see on the tv.",
  "they caught him before he could walk through the front FAC.",
  "yeah i never thought it was scary at all.",
  "thats exactly what i was thinking.",
  "yes thank you",
  "i guess TYPE_OF_SPORT wasn't so popular back then.",
  "was it very old FAC?",
  "i want the autonomous PRODUCT.",
  "i don't think they look alike either.",
  "and got a FAC named after him!",
  "i  agree do you know he also voice a famous WORK_OF_ART.",
  "i like them",
  "but i want to burn up more FOOD!",
  "interesting WORK_OF_ART i have to watch that one.",
  "i thought they were good!",
  "i wonder that too!",
  "cya",
  "yes they are called the ORG.",
  "no. tell me about it!",
  "i cannot say that i do actually.",
  "i appreciate you saying that and would like you to join us in our EVENT.",
  "i don't find this surprising.",
  "is it far from here to LOCATION?",
  "i would love to hear that.",
  "i have a b.a. in ACADEMIC_DISCIPLINE.",
  "i have golfed.",
  "not sure actually.",
  "that would be cool if you could live in a PRODUCT.",
  "i've heard about that PRODUCT.",
  "the OCCUPATION can also get injured.",
  "wow, you're really informative.",
  "well, can you explain it to me?",
  "that is so ironic.",
  "i'm awfully sorry to have bothered you.",
  "it was nice to chat",
  "naah man.",
  "i'm female and old.",
  "i cannot even imagine that.",
  "they probably go pretty deep.",
  "is that really true?",
  "no. who?",
  "no i don't have one.",
  "that is a little late to graduate hs.",
  "yeah i would think so as well.",
  "well. good for her!",
  "thank you, this is mine.",
  "he built his own PRODUCT?",
  "pretty much how it goes unfortunately.",
  "where did you transfer from?",
  "is there anything i can do?",
  "what should he have then?",
  "i haven't seen that actually.",
  "i ’ ll take this stew then.",
  "i was born during his second EVENT.",
  "ya that is really sad.",
  "the PRODUCT is rather narrow.",
  "it is worth looking forward to.",
  "now that sounds like something i would like to see!",
  "that is huge.",
  "no i didn't catch that actually.",
  "as i said.",
  "i think it would be interesting.",
  "you could.",
  "dammit!",
  "$ 200?",
  "you might as well stay here.",
  "i'd be happy to do something new.",
  "yeah they certainly are.",
  "oh for sure.",
  "i work in a FAC too, but i don't mind it.",
  "do you mind if i speak frankly?",
  "lets talk about the ORG next.",
  "that doesn't surprise me honestly.",
  "he's got a good OCCUPATION.",
  "i'm totally with you on that.",
  "thank you so much.",
  "that's tough indeed!",
  "yeah thats cool.",
  "that would be fun to see!",
  "sounds like that might drive me crazy.",
  "i  guess he is.",
  "what're you talking about?",
  "oh maybe.",
  "i can see why.",
  "someone called PERSON.",
  "oh this is interesting...",
  "how did that even get on the EVENT!",
  "no i don't",
  "yeah he was really good at the three.",
  "that ’ s not right, somebody should do something.",
  "i tend to disagree but that sounds like something the ORG would be doing",
  "the PRODUCT t was done in 1908.",
  "that ’ s what i charge.",
  "wow he sounds gifted to say the least.",
  "that ’ s good to know.",
  "that's really weird....",
  "yeah i would feel bad too.",
  "that is really awesome.",
  "well, i'm only making one PRODUCT, so i guess i can afford it.",
  "which do you prefer.",
  "i'm not sure if that's a good LAW or not.",
  "ahah see?",
  "i think its made by the same ORG or something like that.",
  "it's probably the same.",
  "if you don't mind, i would appreciate it if you would pick up my PRODUCT.",
  "i know i have been trying to get one installed in my PRODUCT",
  "i've never listened to it.",
  "i'd love to go to his upcoming EVENT at the birchmere!",
  "obviously you did enjoy the EVENT.",
  "it's better because it doesn't tie up the PRODUCT.",
  "is there any special BUSINESS you would like?",
  "i would assume so too.",
  "well, you have to make sure that your anti-virus PRODUCT is updated regularly.yours wasn't up to date, that ’ s probably what was causing your problems.",
  "yes it sounds so peaceful.",
  "that seems more assumable!",
  "i should start.",
  "he works in LOCATION?",
  "it's not a bad EVENT i guess.",
  "where is WORK_OF_ART?",
  "did he actually ever really drive a real PRODUCT?",
  "yeah that is truly amazing.",
  "i bet it's peaceful and clean.",
  "and they are super expensive.",
  "there is a WORK_OF_ART.",
  "probably fighting unfortunately.",
  "nuts!",
  "i kind of agree.",
  "it's hard to say.",
  "actually, i'm already working for BUSINESS.",
  "i don ’ t want to see you back here.",
  "do you think you will want to continue working here even after you ’",
  "i don't think i'd like it there.",
  "there have been many WORK_OF_ART.",
  "since 1998!",
  "what have you got?",
  "it's not that serious.",
  "congratulations!",
  "a there were a few...not huge famous.",
  "i like that one too.",
  "i have been feeling great.",
  "but i bet he would be very nice about it!",
  "i think its small.",
  "i know he's hilarious!",
  "you're probably right about that.",
  "i'd like to think 0.",
  "generally.",
  "i completely agree with that.",
  "he is talented.",
  "i sure am .",
  "i think it's cute.",
  "yeah it definitely must have been.",
  "at FAC.",
  "i'll have to look into that.",
  "could have been.",
  "i'd like to find out where that was too.",
  "i know i have been trying to get one installed on my PRODUCT",
  "yes i though it was pretty good",
  "yes and it has its own private PRODUCT at it",
  "yes, it ’ s.",
  "he didn't call himself that.",
  "it was terrible.",
  "she does indeed.",
  "that makes me think of PERSON.",
  "completely understand.",
  "precisely why they want to shut BUSINESS down.",
  "i guess it takes so long to get to the LOCATION.",
  "that doesn't sound good.",
  "yes, let's total it.",
  "i definitely do.",
  "they must not have slept.",
  "oh, i hope he didn't notice me.",
  "what is it about??",
  "i was just asking.",
  "that's why it's interesting.",
  "but i have to go to my FAC.",

  "super nintendo!",
  "i have never looked into that.",
  "that's cool i did not know that.",
  "that's just over there.",
  "then why do you want to sell it?",
  "speaking of animated WORK_OF_ART.",

  "we live on an interesting LOCATION.",
  "i ’ m going there for a EVENT, too.",
  "no, i often go there with my ORG.",
  "i'm not sure about TYPE_OF_SPORT.",
  "i heard something like that.",
  "i'm afraid we have no more sole.",
  "maybe the MUSIC_GENRE will inspire him.",
  "oh i see, okay.",
  "NATION.",
  "it would probably be easier to say than if it were named LOCATION.",
  "that is crazy.",
  "i think i'll try it.",
  "i haven't no.",
  "you are kidding.",
  "i think we can still talk.",
  "no, it ’ s PRODUCT?",

  "yes, that sounds wonderful.",
  "i often feel so tired.",
  "it feels like the PRODUCT has always been with us.",
  "they are WORK_OF_ART.",
  "we are seeing that in LOCATION.",
  "i wonder how much the PRODUCT cost for it?",
  "you have never used a PRODUCT?",
  "no i am not sure",
  "yeah that is really odd.",
  "if PRODUCT went down.",
  "i haven't seen that one yet.",
  "doesn't shock me at all.",
  "i know pretty interesting.",
  "ok, i'll have mr.PERSON call you as soon as he comes back.",

  "that is exactly what i needed!",
  "yes i agree it would be safer.",
  "will you be getting more in.",
  "FOOD is very popular.",
  "and i'll stick with real FOOD.",

  "we'll all be out of ORG soon.",
  "i wonder how the WORK_OF_ART did it.",

  "she married PERSON.",
  "how do you get away with that twice.",
  "yes, we have.",

  "i definitely have some PERSON.",
  "maybe we should.",
  "no, that ’ s enough, thank you.",
  "i don't own any tv.",
  "does it bother you when you eat something really sweet?",

  "i don't understand how i could've failed it.",
  "yeah, ACADEMIC_DISCIPLINE, what about you?",

  "i wondered that too!",
  "myself as well.",
  "i'm much further away so it would be more difficult.",
  "don't get all worked up over him.",
  "yes it was amazing.",
  "i really like you.",
  "like WORK_OF_ART.",

  "that is pretty bad for sure.",
  "same here i always had ANIMAL growing up.",
  "i would like to read that one too.",
  "top two i guess.",
  "what isn't working on it?",
  "i thought it would have been the other LOCATION around.",
  "he has do you know any?",
  "i wonder who could be in the EVENT.",
  "a NATION.",
  "so what were you calling me about?",
  "and ORG wouldn't have been thorough then if they even existed.",
  "it must've been frustrating but also exciting to create the first PRODUCT.",
  "can you reduce more?",
  "wow!!",
  "that still sounds very cool.",
  "i don't know that he really liked LOCATION.",
  "okay, i will go and get some FOOD first.",
  "that was good.",
  "i was going to mention that too.",
  "it must be pretty funny.",
  "depends if i were sleeping or playing.",
  "for being fined.",
  "i'm sure we can work something out.",
  "i know he had been paralyzed for quite awhile.",
  "i did know that!",
  "it will be interesting to see what they do. .",
  "yes, that is big enough, but it's too heavy for me.",
  "are you on the LOCATION?",
  "it is necessary.",
  "i don't think so.",
  "i'm afraid we can ’ t save that one.",
  "doesn't surprise.",
  "let me go to LOCATION, please!",

  "i think i'll ty the crisp deep-fried FOOD.",
  "now that's interesting.",
  "hey, don't shout.",
  "i'll have to check that out.",
  "i've always been into it.",
  "they think they're anonymous.\" said PERSON.",
  "i don't think that was very professional.",
  "you need not always do that.",
  "i don't like many of the new rookie qbs like PERSON",
  "yeah... is PRODUCT even exists now ?",
  "i did not know about that at all either.",
  "i wonder if that is extra heavy?",
  "yes, thank you.",
  "did you know how the circular PRODUCT was invented?",
  "i guess they practice.",
  "while i do not disagree.",
  "no it's not legal.",
  "yes, we've already prepared one.",
  "i did not before now.",
  "that really is hard to believe.",
  "you mean they ’ re kicking you out?",
  "that's easy to believe.",
  "it is shocking!",
  "my OCCUPATION just came back in.",
  "not really, so long as you follow all the LAW.",
  "yeah i would have to agree with you on that.",
  "perhaps...",
  "have read it .",
  "speaking of PERSON.",
  "well anyways.",
  "it sounds like ORG isn't that advanced either!",
  "i find is very silly that we no longer consider it a LOCATION.",
  "i agreed, hi, guess what?",
  "oh no i have not!",
  "he must have been enormous.",
  "ok, i ’ ll take it.",
  "yeah he was quite a WORK_OF_ART.",
  "that i certainly didn't know.",
  "yeah that's very impressive.",
  "i think that is pretty wild.",
  "he deserves it.",
  "that's really sad.",
  "i never read that one either.",
  "how creative.",
  "i would suppose so.",
  "yep that's what i love about it.",
  "that they do.",
  "i found that very psychedelic.",
  "yeah that is impressive.",
  "it is 3g!",
  "i did not know it was flooding in dc.",
  "at 7:30 p. m.",
  "oh ok i see.",
  "that should be changed!",
  "should i call the ORG?",
  "now they are huge!",
  "i know that we have already destroyed over 80% of the LOCATION in it",
  "perhaps the FOOD was bad.",
  "tell me more about it i have never even heard of it",
  "that is so creepy.",
  "it seems unfortunate.",
  "but then again.",
  "that's very sensible of you.",
  "adidas?",
  "i bought mine from BUSINESS.",
  "ah yes, i can see it now.",
  "i think it is awesome!",
  "i try to catch the latest.",

  "at ORG.",
  "yeah 7% seems high",
  "i've actually been pretty good.",
  "yeah it seems like they would be very effective in preventing carjacking.",
  "ya i wonder what would happen.",
  "i used to love watching it.",
  "but how can you do that?",
  "what you would like me to do about it?",
  "i can send somebody right now to fix it.",
  "i dont think he did.",
  "PRODUCT 38 or 39.",
  "this is tragic.",
  "i wonder how often that happens.",
  "i bet it had FOOD all over it....",
  "they did something really great.",
  "thats neat.",
  "it is an WORK_OF_ART.",
  "yeah i think it holds up a little better now.",
  "i don't know if i have watched it.",
  "no, i'll pay.",
  "i do have a few.",
  "i know it had something to do with a FOOD.",
  "we use a PRODUCT for sure.",
  "oh wow that is very interesting.",
  "yes, well done.",
  "no, you needn't.",
  "how did you do it?",
  "they probably regret that.",
  "that makes it very interesting!",
  "i heard they do that in NATION.",
  "i'm not quite sure.",
  "that's helpful.",
  "yes, it is, but not as hot as in LOCATION.",
  "i have actually never use BUSINESS.",
  "no i don't think that i have.",
  "that sounds prohibitively expensive.",
  "now that is something id want to hear!",
  "that is slightly racist.",
  "that would be amusing.",
  "it won't take long.",
  "i will have to try that.",
  "very clever.",
  "i'm sure it must have taken forever.",
  "why do you assume that?",
  "oh, we're not driving.",
  "i like ORG.",
  "i prefer to learn LANGUAGE.",
  "how about at 6 pm?",
  "i can't wait to my my own PRODUCT!",
  "no, one thousand at least.",
  "i can't say that i like her dislike her.",
  "that sounds fair.",
  "he must have been quite talented.",
  "that will be interesting to see.",
  "yes he really liked the WORK_OF_ART.",
  "holy smokes!",
  "probably why he never mentioned it.",
  "do you mean to say you refuse us the ORG?",
  "that's what i plan on doing unless i keep screwing up.",
  "okay, i got it.",
  "sad that he sold it .",
  "i admire PRODUCT",
  "i work in ACADEMIC_DISCIPLINE.",
  "can i PRODUCT it?",
  "hurry!",
  "that is scary.",
  "NORP aren't all terrible though.",
  "great, i love hot FOOD too.",
  "actually it was pretty low.",
  "they're not bad.",
  "it's weird.",
  "i can't believe he never fumbled.",
  "i see that is interesting.",
  "very smart!",
  "yeah it seems rehearsed",
  "i've never heard that.",
  "let me check...",
  "never!",
  "that sounds neat though.",
  "sounds like it happened.",
  "she's terribly sorry about that.",
  "i grew up on BUSINESS.",
  "they fit me very well.",
  "that would be my WORK_OF_ART.",
  "what else can i help you with?",
  "yeah that is so sexist and outdated and i really think it needs to go now",
  "im not even sure what that mean.",
  "that is high.",
  "let's talk about EVENT.",
  "yeah especially TYPE_OF_SPORT i guess.",
  "i would love that if i couldnt use those PRODUCT.",
  "has anything been upsetting you lately?",
  "there were six of us.",
  "it is really nice.",
  "that's very unfortunate",
  "i understand the baked FOOD.",
  "ya that is odd.",
  "ha ha i agree with you there.",
  "i can't agree with you.",
  "i guess he only got paid $7.500.",
  "that is some PRODUCT!",
  "she could never be qb.",
  "not really many.",
  "i would never have guessed that at all.",
  "okay, thank you.",
  "um... how can i put this?",
  "i don't think he did.",
  "umm, ok.whatever you think will help.",
  "yes it does indeed.",
  "sure, please hold on.",
  "we want to order 900 PRODUCT.",
  "yes indeed it would.",
  "that's why it looks so nice.",
  "i think he's hilarious!",
  "i would be also.",
  "i am really puzzled about that one really.",
  "how's that?",
  "wow i guess that is how you combat NORP and such",
  "i only have seen it because my ORG watched it.",
  "i knew that was their WORK_OF_ART all along!",
  "i suppose that's true.",
  "well, it's not as good as my LANGUAGE.",
  "this is for internal PRODUCT.",
  "just look around?",
  "he is what about tony stark?",
  "i can help you there.",
  "yeah i hope you are right.",
  "oh i love the walking dead!",
  "mmm!",
  "that was who i grew up to.",
  "i appreciate it.",
  "it's surprising how much the TYPE_OF_SPORT has evolved since then.",
  "then you know it must be special!",
  "can be.",
  "i think it was both.",
  "i wonder if that's ever happened before?",
  "what about with BUSINESS?",
  "i can't imagine it could have been any worse so i don't think it would have mattered.",
  "i'm very pleased.",
  "yes, i don't want to be stuck in a LOCATION.",
  "could be like LOCATION.",
  "i think it would be entertaining but pointless.",
  "i get what you mean.",
  "party?",
  "ya i favor the ORG too.",
  "two small PRODUCT.",
  "to be honest, i ’ m not, and i regret a little what i have done.",
  "no.i never heard about him.",
  "it is expensive.",
  "yes he sure is.",
  "it does seem pretty cool.",
  "well it was nice talking with you :)",
  "i think i remember that.",
  "its been a digital WORK_OF_ART.",
  "i don't know any.",
  "yes, i know where the BUSINESS is.",
  "interesting. is that true?",
  "i question that too.",
  "i doubt we are doing anything.",
  "ya a steve martin contest!",
  "do you have any going anywhere in the eu?",
  "i generally will tune out until the SPORTS_SEASON.",
  "has he won a SPORTS_EVENT?",
  "well in some LOCATION.",
  "our first EVENT is next monday.",
  "i'll have to look it up then if that is suggested for them.",
  "how long do you think she'll be?",
  "well, that ’ s good.",
  "it truly is and then again it can be kind of simple.",
  "superman.",
  "no. didnt know about that until just know.",
  "so you should bring an PRODUCT often.",
  "more than likely.",
  "i'm not sure if he did or not.",
  "i have an electric PRODUCT.",
  "i would buy one too so 1.001!",
  "i'm so terribly sorry to keep you waiting.",
  "what, it keeps coming back?",
  "probably not as much as i should.",
  "yep i would feel really bad too!",
  "nice.. i do not think i have read that one.",
  "mm, it is.",
  "possibly!",
  "i think he deserved it too.",
  "he really knows BUSINESS.",
  "yeah. too bad he probably didn't get to profit much off of it",
  "i never thought of that before.",
  "i'm not surprised by that either.",
  "WORK_OF_ART are really cute too!",
  "and i've ordered the PRODUCT.",
  "no ti is not.",
  "wow i did see that one.",
  "i am very surprised by that.",
  "since '98?",
  "do you enjoy reading?",
  "ok, that sounds fine.",
  "i have never watched it either.",
  "that is super cool!",
  "oh, that's terrible!",
  "yeah, where is yours?",
  "but surely they won't fire you!",
  "that should keep someone slim.",
  "i wonder if it works though?",
  "either that or he was just that good",
  "do you know how to set up the PRODUCT?",
  "they would become collector's WORK_OF_ART.",
  "let me pay for it.",
  "yes. are you?",
  "maybe we should make fb illegal.",
  "guess they did want him to vote.",
  "i have learn about those two ACADEMIC_DISCIPLINE as well.",
  "what!?!?!",
  "we do charge to use the PRODUCT.",
  "yes, we have to.",
  "i can understand that.",
  "oh, i guess i really did get ripped off.",
  "no i haven't yet!",
  "yeah me either!",
  "some were a little out there though.",
  "yeah i think i would be good with one million.",
  "yes i most certainly do.",
  "i would be afraid to say something i shouldnt.",
  "it was back in 1932.",
  "well, we don't usually do it, but...",
  "she ’ s going to live in LOCATION.",
  "right, so you didn ’ t get lost?",
  "i do not know why.",
  "yeah, sure, you won't be disappointed.",
  "oh wow i would for sure do that!",
  "that is really interesting.",
  "yes i definitely am what about you.",
  "i'm not sure why it flopped.",
  "they did not and seems they did not do it just to make it convenient.",
  "that was kind of him.",
  "i wonder how accurate that PRODUCT was.",
  "i have not seen it",
  "i'd like to see it for myself.",
  "i thought it was over there.",
  "i wonder how a deaf qb communicated with the OCCUPATION.",
  "i ’ m surprised to hear you say so.",
  "ya i think so.",
  "yes that's true at the very least it could be taught as just what it is.",
  "we have developed new PRODUCT about it.",
  "that's pretty neat.",
  "well, as the other ORG are still not in, i ’ ll introduce you to them later.",
  ":) do you have a ANIMAL?",
  "oh yeah definitely.",
  "it should work, but let me know if it doesn't.",
  "please come again.",
  "perhaps you should exercise more.",
  "i'm not sure i understand your \"no\".",
  "well it paid off for him it seems.",
  "i dont listen to enough to know.",
  "i am not from the LOCATION",
  "wow i did not know that.",
  "haven't heard of it.",
  "that is very weird.",
  "that seems too recent.",
  "he didn't mean to stay in the us.",
  "i am sure he did.",
  "more imaginative than any other current PRODUCT.",
  "he is really outrageous.",
  "it ’ s slow.",
  "the NATION are creating one.",
  "because it is the fastest to dial on a rotary PRODUCT.",
  "it ’ s just a NORP of ours.",
  "same i wouldn't either.",
  "have you ever uploaded a WORK_OF_ART there?",
  "i've not heard of that, could you tell me more, please?",
  "i can do both.",
  "i do like TYPE_OF_SPORT.",
  "yeah you might be right about that.",
  "oh i was thinking about WORK_OF_ART in general.",
  "in this PRODUCT, we sell it for 53.95.",
  "he is very interesting and challenging.",
  "you are very optimistic!",
  "i like WORK_OF_ART more.",
  "yes i'd have to look it up.",
  "where ’ s the FOOD?",
  "actually that is what i though",
  "FOOD?",
  "i do not know too much.",
  "it is silly.",
  "don ’ t pretend you are a good god.",
  "wish we had more of those around!",
  "mmmbop!",
  "i wonder if i have anything there.",
  "i would like to do that.",
  "apparently LOCATION does!",
  "it doesn't sound so great.",
  "because i think it's boring",
  "oh i would definitely be.",
  "that would be very nice.",
  "ah i see, so you were actually educated in LOCATION?",
  "i bet that is true.",
  "hmm interesting...",
  "i can ’ t tell you that.",
  "that surprises me.",
  "that looks great.",
  "they're just PRODUCT i bought.",
  "it was a WORK_OF_ART really?",
  "yes, but you don't even have to sing.",
  "that's not that old.",
  "i think i heard about that too!",
  "kind of...",
  "it was fun!",
  "it was very good.",
  "okay.do you like to purchase in PRODUCT?",
  "and where are we going to go?",
  "what about this one?",
  "perhaps maybe all FOOD would be immortal if they weren't so delicious",
  "even crazier.",
  "they're really just fun to listen to.",
  "oh, i hardly ever exercise.",
  "oh i remember.",
  "well that should be pretty interesting.",
  "no, you can walk from here.",
  "i did not watch TYPE_OF_SPORT at all growing up.",
  "ok.i'll do it right away, but tell me how it happened.",
  "very much so .",
  "yes, but that doesn't make them right, does it?",
  "they offer clearer and sharper WORK_OF_ART.",
  "no, we are just too different.",
  "uh!",
  "how much, please?",
  "they are from LOCATION.",
  "yeah i guess it kind of does look silly.",
  "i heard that but wonder how they determined it?",
  "i read something like that once.",
  "yeah thinking about how much both BUSINESS are worth is pretty crazy.",
  "interesting i didn't know that.",
  "ahh...that's why he was on my mind.",
  "that wouldn't be me!",
  "yeah i never saw one.",
  "that does seem odd.",
  "it doesn't matter, i can teach you.",
  "i didn't hear about that.",
  "you're kidding me!",
  "you don't have to lie.",
  "yes it's kind of sad actually.",
  "yep you can say that again?",
  "i though it was 54.",
  "i wonder how that is even possible i would love to know more about that.",
  "i wonder who created it",
  "were you suppose to be there?",
  "if you log in some formal PRODUCT, it must be very safe.",
  "i wasn't aware of that either.",
  "sure that sounds good.",
  "yeah i definitely do.",
  "i like mellow MUSIC_GENRE.",
  "im not sure the ORG is competent enough for that.",
  "yeah they have owned it since 1998.",
  "how much do they cost?",
  "really amazing.",
  "i wish!",
  "who knows maybe if we flew them to LOCATION.",
  "i apologize, and i'll make sure he doesn't do that again.",
  "how long will it take for them to get here?",
  "let me see if he is free.",
  "think so....crazy.",
  "wow, it ’ s nice.",
  "BUSINESS definitely won't censor that.",
  "i see... calm down, don't worry.",
  "how much will i have to pay?",
  "yeah that's very shocking.",
  "you sure do.",
  "that ’ s exactly what i ’ m getting at.",
  "no, it's just the two of us.",
  "it just keeps going and going.",
  "wow. who accused you of freebooting.",
  "i didn't either honestly.",
  "that's a pretty unique WORK_OF_ART!",
  "i've seen it once when i was younger.",
  "that's so interesting!",
  "yeah always fun when the EVENT come around.",
  "yeah the SPORTS_SEASON get really interesting.",
  "thats right.",
  "i wonder how they verify that!",
  "ah thats interesting.",
  "what's in it?",
  "hmm that is very strange.",
  "thats actually pretty amazing.",
  "sci-fi?",
  "can i help in anyway?",
  "oh, you do?",
  "i won't tell you, unless you promise to let me watch it with you.",
  "on PRODUCT",
  "it might actually help him.",
  "that's pretty crazy!",
  "we are not as athletic as we were when young.",
  "that sounds disgusting but he is very healthy.",
  "yeah that is pretty cool .",
  "maybe i'll run away first.",
  "not just that.",
  "you did pretty bad.",
  "that is so neat!",
  "i hope so too.",
  "are you having any FOOD?",
  "i'll check it over.",
  "yes, i do.",
  "i think that's great!",
  "that's a little scary!",
  "his MUSIC_GENRE is pretty classic.",
  "it doesn't matter.",
  "yeah i would be scared.",
  "it can't be dry, and can't die.",
  "that is very sad.",
  "not much at all.",
  "that sounds like it would be very funny to hear!",
  "not in LOCATION.",
  "i remember PERSON he was a really talented qb.",
  "well that's good",
  "yes, that would be lovely.",
  "i always thought they looked silly dressed like that.",
  "it is the LOCATION.",
  "yeah it is really creepy actually however it works",
  "did not.",
  "i  do like PRODUCT.",
  "to be quirky .",
  "i wonder what PERSON will be remembered for.",
  "did you know that using of \"red\" and \"blue\" PRODUCT only started in 2000?",
  "some of them.",
  "i'm perfect with my PRODUCT.",
  "that wouldn't happen.",
  "yeah i did know about that.",
  "that would be interesting to look up!",
  "it was PERSON who played him.",
  "yeah i think i read about them stating that.",
  "i wish the us was like LOCATION.",
  "that is really cool and i think that is really deserves to be in there as well.",
  "that's exactly what i want.",
  "i think i heard that from somewhere before.",
  "i wish we could, but we can't, you see, we are not insured.",
  "but it seems the ACADEMIC_DISCIPLINE are the same.",
  "no that is really smart though.",
  "oh, nothing much really.",
  "that does sound better!",
  "i wonder why i never learned any of that in LOCATION!",
  "ya i wonder what that sounds like!",
  "interesting and crazy",
  "i did not know that since he's one of the central WORK_OF_ART i would imagine he's always included.",
  "that's impressive in 5 different LANGUAGE.",
  "i did not realize that either.",
  "i wonder what that would be like.",
  "he was a POLITICAL_PARTY.",
  "yes you are correct.",
  "that's pretty incredible he never fumbled once.",
  "thank you.that will be all.",
  "i wonder if those were any good.",
  "i do like the ORG.",
  "i think she is really going to like her OCCUPATION though.",
  "yeah geez i'm sure they could make one out of that without even trying very hard!",
  "i go as much as i can actually.",
  "i think that's because it's such a worldwide TYPE_OF_SPORT.",
  "i should admit that sometimes i care too much about the ACADEMIC_DISCIPLINE.",
  "i'm sure it is since i've never heard it brought up until now.",
  "ok, now we are getting some where.",
  "if i saw the FAC sign, i would've FACped for it.",
  "i don't dance.",
  "he is a great OCCUPATION.",
  "LOCATION there is only one.",
  "i was hoping you would come.",
  "that is amazing to think about.",
  "yeah. need to walk softly and carry a big PRODUCT.",
  "i clicked it once.",
  "i think he helped design it maybe?",
  "he wore them anyway huh?",
  "i think a six is your PRODUCT.",
  "that could be true.",
  "it's good, try it.",
  "do you like to use PRODUCT.",
  "maybe i've got a higher eq.i'm not sure.",
  "not angry at all!",
  "that would be interested.",
  "i am going to check that out.",
  "insightful.",
  "wow i wish i could see that.",
  "kind of like a PRODUCT?",
  "i would imagine you are right.",
  "it ’ s the same in PRODUCT.",
  "i may consider looking into that.",
  "i don't think i've every played that probably because it seemed impossible to win anything to me.",
  "if anyone can do it.",
  "i bet the PRODUCT is pretty restrictive.",
  "that's impressive!",
  "that is called a nuclear ORG.",
  "that is just amazing to me to read that.",
  "yeah, but it's so hard.",
  "oh i have.",
  "ha i don't know how i feel about that.",
  "oh, did you?",
  "that sounds like a very different PRODUCT.",
  "that's great for me.",
  "it likely changed when the different political POLITICAL_PARTY began forming.",
  "i do too!",
  "oh you definitely should go!",
  "i've been on a ANIMAL once.",
  "it apparently costs almost $300 to travel across the LOCATION.",
  "ok cool i'll put that on now.",
  "how much do i owe?",
  "its a demanding PRODUCT for sure.",
  "it may seem simple but PRODUCT are really versatile",
  "not sure but would like to know too.",
  "who told you that?",
  "not surprising.",
  "i don",
  "i always hate PERSON for how disrespectful he was towards her",
  "oh wow that is rough.",
  "ya i think it's boring too.",
  "i think it's quite enough.",
  "yeah i know that sadly we have destroyed 80% of the LOCATION",
  "do you think that this will move along fairly quickly?",
  "where are you going now?",
  "well, i adjust going to have to disagree with you.",
  "let's get started with this PRODUCT then.",
  "i thought it was kind of late.",
  "i always wear PRODUCT.",
  "those are the best.",
  "i love going to the FAC to read.",
  "i never saw that either.",
  "i have not heard about that.",
  "let ’ s see.",
  "that is just crazy.",
  "yeah i guess they were close!",
  "i like playing TYPE_OF_SPORT.",
  "yep they all did.",
  "i haven't got much.",
  "very few, unfortunately.",
  "i've never seen that one.",
  "yes, that ’ s right.",
  "it is depressing.",
  "it's still early.",
  "yeah good for him for sure.",
  "i like FOOD myself.",
  "please try the BUSINESS there.",
  "agreed :)",
  "okay, here's my id and the $ 27.",
  "you should definetely do it!",
  "what was the ORG even doing with them?",
  "i think BUSINESS will.",
  "have you tried this PRODUCT?",
  "no, just FOOD.",
  "i have indeed heard about that.",
  "he definitely could.",
  "WORK_OF_ART is good.",
  "ANIMAL are pretty cool.",
  "i'm not sure, but i don't think she's given out that many.",
  "it's already half past four.",
  "yeah, but that's not why i am upset.",
  "i'm a POLITICAL_PARTY and i don't get it either.",
  "i know it doesnt seem like it would solve much.",
  "jones.",
  "no i'm not sure i know about that!",
  "i had to visit all my ORG.",
  "i think i did.",
  "ok, i will see it soon.",
  "and those PRODUCT?",
  "i wonder why they made more.",
  "i can boil it, grill it, or microwave it.",
  "TYPE_OF_SPORT is nice and fast paced!",
  "ah yes.",
  "yeah it hasn't been balanced in awhile.",
  "oh ya he was great.",
  "i know i can't imagine listening to that.",
  "and it just lays there!",
  "i  didnt",
  "i haven't eaten there before.",
  "that it did.",
  "no it doesn't me either.",
  "i would agree too.",
  "i wonder also.",
  "i would not doubt it.",
  "i agree and it was good chatting with you too.",
  "that can be fun on long PRODUCT.",
  "i just finished breaking bad.",
  "a FOOD sounds good.",
  "it looks so cute.",
  "i'll pick you up.",
  "i'm sorry, we only sell at fixed BUSINESS.",
  "you should know that already.",
  "i bet they will.",
  "i can't say that i've seen WORK_OF_ART.",
  "i bet he was!",
  "i saw they turned it down for $75 million.",
  "how do they stay up there so long?",
  "we can.",
  "will, that'll be the sixth of september.",
  "that does surprise me.",
  "probably but they can afford it.",
  "yes, you're lucky.",
  "PRODUCT is pretty much antique  and may smell really bad .",
  "i also grew up in a big ORG.",
  "turkey mover?",
  "yeah and he did pretty well.",
  "i think he might still be playing.",
  "it is fascinating i agree with you.",
  "yes, it happens.",
  "mine are 5 & 7",
  "they are very shallow NATION.",
  "i would like to listen to that one.",
  "yeah that might be upsetting to him.",
  "i was shocked.",
  "...",
  "i thought he was the richest and WORK_OF_ART makes even less only $80 billion/",
  "what were you thinking?",
  "that's so awesome.",
  "they need to write these down because i am getting confused...",
  "yeah, how do you know about that?",
  "i do not travel internationally so i am not sure.",
  "yes, that's all right.",
  "that's fast.",
  "she's not really doing anything.",
  "i'm sure he could, but i prefer not to bother him.",
  "ok.do you want to order something else?",
  "how in the world?",
  "so you are saying that i should eat, but i should just watch what i eat?",
  "i remember hearing about that!",
  "i hate them as well.",
  "i think thats good.",
  "no, i'll stay here at the BUSINESS.",
  "yeah i don't use it that much either.",
  "i never went skydiving but sounds fun!",
  "just the PRODUCT.",
  "that's awesome.",
  "yeah i guess it does.",
  "he was convicted of lying about it to ORG.",
  "washington.",
  "i was about to say.",
  "no i agree.",
  "well, now we're stuck.",
  "i do enjoy it.",
  "the ORG don't know who did it.",
  "yes'm.",
  "it seems like something that would originate over there.",
  "so strange that they would do that.",
  "in 1912 LAW.",
  "his last few SPORTS_SEASON have been rough.",
  "i hope i will meet her soon.",
  "MUSIC_GENRE is my favourite.",
  "i just might.",
  "in just one WORK_OF_ART?",
  "oh wow that is hard to believe-those ORG must have been so smart to set that up!",
  "i totally agree with you there!!",
  "medium rare, please.",
  "i did use it.",
  "elvin?",
  "why do you think that?",
  "it depends on what you want.",
  "basically WORK_OF_ART.",
  "that's fine, thank you.",
  "i guess someone just had to be the first to play a PRODUCT so high up.",
  "yeah you should really try it.",
  "yes, so they are no longer being sold.",
  "you watch BUSINESS.",
  "that's really cool to have something so popular like that.",
  "from that album ?",
  "eight.",
  "i can't see it.",
  "how long did you work in dc?",
  "yep he did it right.",
  "i know what you mean about that.",
  "i was preparing my FOOD but i've finished now.",
  "i don't know much about them.",
  "it certainly will!",
  "well, that's nice i guess.",
  "i don't think that's true...",
  "i enjoyed chatting with you as well!",
  "i've never been to one either",
  "ya maybe they are really good?",
  "i think i've heard that before.",
  "yep that is something worthy to be respected.",
  "i like it when i watch on tv.",
  "yes, i will be able to make it then.",
  "well, i will try.",
  "that is amazing actually.",
  "now i know that something bad is up!",
  "haha oh humane king kong?",
  "it doesn't cost me as much to wash here.",
  "i suppose if you have to survive.",
  "that sounds simple enough.",
  "i guess its too hard to build FAC there?",
  "did they?",
  "well, it seems you'll have to learn some LANGUAGE too, won't you?",
  "i don't think it's broken.",
  "i'm not too surprised.",

  "that will work.",
  "did you have a PRODUCT?",
  "nope you won't.",
  "yeah and they were for sure very saggy",

  "then let's go to that BUSINESS.",
  "that will make him so happy.",
  "yes, you're right.",
  "that ’ s quite a while.",
  "oh, it was nothing.",

  "the ORG might have them beat with 263 concerts'",
  "that sounds about what happens with me as well.",
  "do you want to buy something else?",
  "hmm, maybe i do.",
  "that must have been awkward.",
  "2004 to now.",
  "i don't know much about the PRODUCT",

  "where do i start?",
  "its terrible what we are doing to this LOCATION.",
  "holy cow!",

  "i'll tell you what.",
  "i didn't know anything about that either.",
  "geez.",
  "like PERSON.",
  "i guess that makes us little WORK_OF_ART.",
  "did you know that she had to walk backward to avoid having her WORK_OF_ART taken",
  "sure, i promise.",
  "i also heard about it.",
  "it sure doesn't.",
  "yeah you should check it out.",
  "but i probably can't afford it.",
  "well speaking of that.",
  "you wouldn ’ t dare do that!",
  "i would love to go to the FAC.",
  "yes you as well.",
  "that was a gross LAW.",
  "that was really smart.",
  "he went to the FAC.",
  "i just heard about that.",
  "that's a good PRODUCT.",
  "yeah i usually only watch during the SPORTS_EVENT.",
  "i don't know how much we can trust them.",
  "yeah they definitely do.",
  "PRODUCT is interesting.",
  "oh that's terrible!",
  "let me see here...",

  "why do you want to go to the us?",
  "yes i would imagine so.",
  "good.",
  "i love your PRODUCT right now.",
  "i agree it is a bad NORP.",
  "i completely agree with that and same is probably true for POLITICAL_PARTY.",
  "i can't dance at all but he was always very agile.",
  "i wouldn't be able too.",
  "when will that be?",
  "they do!",
  "i heard it is effective but definitely silly looking.",
  "i've heard that about him.",
  "so very sad.",
  "what about him being black?",
  "no i dont think i have heard that one.",
  "that's what i heard",
  "you mean you need a more detailed WORK_OF_ART for yourself?",
  "yeah it really has.",
  "that's admirable.",
  "i totally get that.",
  "wow lol!",
  "let's check it out.",
  "how am i supposed to log on to the PRODUCT?",
  "i guess it didn't translate very well to their NORP.",
  "oh, thank you kindly.",
  "that is super gross.",
  "it's a new PRODUCT.",
  "to the FAC please.",
  "i'm fearful",
  "in the current PRODUCT it is.",
  "i can only imagine considering how massive it is.",
  "we try not to because you might have to pay quite a heavy LAW.",
  "yeah he was really angry.",
  "yeah. 60 million.",
  "PRODUCT and 3.",
  "i would like to get that.",
  "rarely.",
  "not sure what they hoped to accomplish since the ORG's were never going to stop clowning them.",
  "yes i try i really want to go to LOCATION though.",
  "i would like that as well.",
  "honorable LAW.",
  "to win.",
  "i'm impressed.",

  "that is far too little.",
  "i do he is funny.",
  "yeah pretty interesting.",
  "i do not have a PRODUCT.",
  "ya that is crazy",
  "i wonder where that is?",
  "it is so incredible that she has been so good for so long.",
  "as shooting.",
  "and here i thought it stood for LOCATION.",
  "what do i do after i've typed in my PRODUCT?",
  "i have and loved it.",
  "that is huge!",
  "not that much actually.",
  "349-95- 8821.",
  "PERSON is entertaining.",
  "probably more than i should.",
  "i think i will also enjoy the MUSIC_GENRE.",
  "oh crazy!",
  "that is difficult to believe!",
  "ha ha...great speaking to you",
  "you can?",
  "i didn't know their either.",
  "i'm impartial to poetry.",
  "that's always a really hard one!",
  "but who would win.",
  "we've only got 20% left to go.",
  "i figure that means you and i. or maybe just you.",
  "i have but not the most recent one.",
  "i'll remember to do that.",
  "no i don't you normally listen to BUSINESS.",
  "i'd be honored.",
  "yeah it clearly didn't translate well.",
  "and do i take that LOCATION?",
  "i would rather do that because at least i could understand.",
  "only as it relates to satire.",
  "you're so thoughtful!",
  "my front PRODUCT was broken.",
  "that will be PRODUCT, please",
  "well, i, umm, i flushed it...",
  "there must be a WORK_OF_ART in there.",
  "have here.",
  "we can work on that!",
  "i want to go there, too.",
  "yeah, yeah,",
  "that's something i definitely intend to research.",
  "she said she was bullied when she was younger.",
  "did i mess up on anything?",
  "why not travel by ourselves?",
  "that would be great!",
  "well, they have it too cold in here.",
  "glad he stuck with TYPE_OF_SPORT though he is good at it.",
  "oh that must have felt amazing for him!",
  "that is very hard to believe.",
  "i imagine you are right about that.",
  "for LOCATION.",
  "i'm still trying to figure out how they verified that.",
  "again?",
  "where did you learn to sing like that?",
  "i have a PRODUCT as well.",
  "yes i bet they are.",
  "no, we don ’ t. we wish we had one.",
  "i did not know that either.",
  "wonder if that was a WORK_OF_ART he used to bash each other.",
  "that's awesome that you understand it so well.",
  "i'm sorry she's gone.",
  "i don't have an BUSINESS.",
  "that is pretty interesting.",
  "i don't know how that will work out for them.",
  "then you haven't browsed PRODUCT before... get online.",
  "i find it sad that this was not done until 2013.",
  "i'm not completely clear on that either.",
  "popularity contest?",
  "oh, shut up.",
  "but she did and made me disappointed.",
  "this PRODUCT looks really expensive though.",
  "wow that's wild!",
  "yeah i have seen that before.",
  "we'll get to go fishing at the LOCATION.",
  "yeah because they were faster at swimming.",
  "he ’ s not quite 25.",
  "like snacking?",
  "oh, you know something.",
  "i had heard that",
  "ok.could you turn it down?",
  "very intriguing.",
  "yes with out them we would be lost.",
  "ya that is crazy.",
  "very true. same here.",
  "ok.guess i have to do that before.",
  "that's much more convenient.",
  "i don't think i did.",
  "yeah otherwise it would get real repetitive.",
  "ok, i will see you then.",
  "i always read the local PRODUCT.",
  "it's impossible for me to get to sleep right now.",
  "you are going to love it very suspensful",
  "yeah he signed a LAW with warner bros.",
  "you should try it.",
  "i think it would have a special LOCATION or something.",
  "that's kind of sad.",
  "full BUSINESS, please.",
  "they weren't wrong since that it seemed to make them work.",
  "i did not know they have a new PRODUCT.",
  "i know they're out there.",
  "you can find anything!",
  "whatever PRODUCT i buy.",
  "well do you enjoying going to EVENT?",
  "in 1876.",
  "WORK_OF_ART is a good one.",
  "i know it all ads up.",
  "they would probably grunt.",
  "how much do you charge?",
  "yeah we seem to be the only ORG.",
  "i'm sure it will!",
  "yes apparently they will!",
  "i think the SPORTS_SEASON are fun.",
  "i'm just fishing from the LOCATION.",
  "speaking of weird WORK_OF_ART.",
  "i think it does not matter.",
  "i know its ancient PRODUCT for sure.",
  "at least he believes he knows what is going on with it",
  "oh.. never heard of them!",
  "you don't have any spare PRODUCT?",
  "no i didn't know that that is interesting though.",
  "i do not know that",
  "well, i'm not authorized to agree to such a big LAW.",
  "have you noticed what has changed?",
  "i heard something about them.",
  "we are checking in.",
  "that's easy.",
  "that's pretty cool!",
  "oh, yes, i have.",
  "wow i would like to read that one.",
  "it's amazing what they've accomplished.",
  "i think you are absolutely correct about that.",
  "that must be amazing.",
  "that i'm not sure about.",
  "i would feel bad for gt.",
  "i think you'll like them.",
  "i ’ m going to paint it pink.",
  "that is amazing i want to try that.",
  "the TYPE_OF_SPORT there is just not as good as in the us.",
  "it looks okay to me.",
  "why ?",
  "that's interesting to think that PRODUCT weren't common back then.",
  "if i can remember right.",
  "i ’ d suggest you buy two.",
  "it went terrible or so i suppose.",
  "super.",
  "i couldn ’ t possibly hire you.",
  "i hope they can use that to make the PRODUCT safer too",
  "i don't watch women's TYPE_OF_SPORT but i believe you when you say they are good.",
  "oh really that is interesting.",
  "i used to collect them.",
  "i don't think he is any good in WORK_OF_ART.",
  "yes and he seems to do more and more.",
  "or good at repairing them.",
  "oh.",
  "i don't really listen to it that much",
  "how funny.",
  "i am rooting for them.",
  "some of my ORG dont actually.",
  "oh they are so vast.",
  "again, you need to think carefully.",
  "i bet it is for sure.",
  "well, i guess we ’ ll just have to wait and see.",
  "sometimes i see.",
  "i guess the ORG is strict about that.",
  "did you ever unfriend anybody ?",
  "i think they will or maybe they already have.",
  "why don't you make a FOOD like that?",
  "what BUSINESS do you shop at?",
  "PERSON testified in congress?",
  "yeah not sure why they recommend that.",
  "for only $75 million too!",
  "do you think so?",
  "thinking back when BUSINESS tv was better.",
  "i ’ m LANGUAGE.",
  "i'm surprised he did.",
  "i just like to laugh.",
  "does it have automatic PRODUCT?.",
  "well its been great talking with you.",
  "i have visited LOCATION in fl.",
  "i was just reading that.",
  "i haven't!",
  "i wouldn't mind eating some FOOD.",
  "probably felt pretty silly!",
  "you would need to speak to ms.PERSON.",
  "i ’ ll need to check.",
  "yeah i know what you mean.",
  "let me know if i can help.",
  "exactly i prefer PRODUCT.",
  "i am surprised he has not come out to apologize or reaffirm his NORP of those he coaches.",
  "well what do you think about the OCCUPATION?",
  "i had never heard of that.",
  "anyone can play but there are some ORG that take it super seriously!",
  "why should he do that?",
  "they use so much bandwidth.",
  "ok i'll check it out.",
  "i can agree with that.",
  "yes, it keeps me going.",
  "i still watch the first one.",
  "ok, i will be there around 6.",
  "actually, he excels in it.",
  "please go over there to weigh them.",
  "i think i would always just read it backwards PRODUCT.",
  "yes, i have everything here.",
  "i wonder if it was for him.",
  "if i could make as much as her.",
  "i would like to travel to the uk and LOCATION.",
  "i sure didn't that made me mad when i found out that's what he used.",
  "i do and you're right.",
  "no.  that is suggested reading for military ORG.",
  "yes, i know my PRODUCT is quite thin.",
  "he has?",
  "seems like someone got robbed.",
  "i read it in an PRODUCT.",
  "that's probably something her ex.",
  "ok yeah that was really sad when he passed.",
  "no it is not.",
  "i do not actually",
  "i would have thought there was more than one.",
  "yeah it was one of the comic WORK_OF_ART.",
  "that is very interesting and concerning.",
  "we did have one when i was very little.",
  "no, that would be crazy.",
  "i'm so happy that they were making PRODUCT's until 2003!",
  "i have an BUSINESS also.",
  "she what?",
  "they are a very uncomplicated WORK_OF_ART.",
  "i will.",
  "i bet it was super easy.",
  "im kinda the same there.",
  "i have actually and i am fine with it",
  "no, that's PRODUCT.",
  "i do not think that will happen.",
  "they did lol.",
  "ok.thank you.",
  "it's been nice chatting with you as well.",
  "that ’ s impressive.",
  "not that well.",
  "don't worry about the LAW.",
  "i heard it is legal in LOCATION.",
  "you've got to, i'm afraid.",
  "ok.i gotta call mine too.",
  "ya that is true.",
  "what are you majoring in?",
  "let ’ s move the PRODUCT.",
  "i am curious as to why you want to leave your current BUSINESS.",
  "they were a driven ORG!",
  "yes he is a smart OCCUPATION that is why he has achieved so much",
  "yep you're 100% right.",
  "i'm not from this LOCATION.",
  "pretty cool!",
  "yes, very gorgeous.",
  "here and there.",
  "just throw them away!",
  "it's possible.",
  "i didn't like it myself.",
  "it's very light.",
  "he definitely employs someone.",
  "that's very possible.",
  "oh, i guess i'm a little confused.",
  "i'm glad to know that everyone made it out okay.",
  "have to admit though.",
  "i remember the WORK_OF_ART.",
  "PERSON lol",
  "that's seems obvious enough.then what about the PRODUCT?",
  "nope i agree with you!",
  "i knew you'd come around...",
  "i hope you have a good PRODUCT.",
  "yes, if you could.",
  "well, i am.",
  "did he really?",
  "ya i need to look that up.",
  "or at least the 21st WORK_OF_ART!",
  "johnathan lithgow!",
  "i have not heard of her.",
  "i actually think LOCATION would be beautiful to visit but very cold.",
  "i should have known it was you.",
  "that is creepy.",
  "thank you, dear.",
  "with that i agree.",
  "i had a bearded WORK_OF_ART once.",
  "have you ever talked to them about it?",
  "i'm not sure, but we can find out.",
  "i need to study that jellyfish ANIMAL then.",
  "cool!",
  "i think it's because it was easy to dial on old PRODUCT.",
  "i do want to send it PRODUCT, yes.",
  "thats sad.",
  "do we have PRODUCT?",
  "i'm so glad they broke up.",
  "i almost don't want to know what they did to get rid of them.",
  "i still think nobody plays for nothing.",
  "do what we have to.",
  "i had it on cd.",
  "that's really nice!",
  "they did!?",
  "it was 2005.",
  "yeah, it was nice to meet you.",
  "ai is fascinating.",
  "i can't believe how stupid you are.",
  "i don't really...know too much about TYPE_OF_SPORT.",
  "he showed them!",
  "i'm okay, thank you.",
  "what do you think about her as a OCCUPATION?",
  "very surprising to say the least.",
  "it ’ s half past twelve.",
  "i wrote it out for $ 150.",
  "i hope it can live up to the original.",
  "i know right.",
  "how did it go?",
  "oh, i was just thinking about getting a FOOD to eat.",
  "occasionally skim though it  but not really.",
  "i'd guess that they have at least 1500!",
  "not really everything's digital now.",
  "that smells great.",
  "thank you for your delicious FOOD.",
  "yeah and look where it got him.",
  "oh, i see him now.",
  "probably 1986 only PRODUCT.",
  "do you think they could improve it ?",
  "do you what they tried to accomplish with that ?",
  "WORK_OF_ART are so interesting.",
  "basketball is cool too!",
  "did you play at all?",
  "yes, but you need install it after downloading so that you can use it.",
  "i think you'll find i'm worth that.",
  "huh..i did not know that.",
  "i wonder whether we'll get discovered first.",
  "you like aggressive WORK_OF_ART?",
  "i think i heard something about that before!",
  "being allergic to both i would be able to work with either",
  "that's exactly what happened!",
  "i just learned that you lose 180 FOOD.",
  "i never heard that myself.",
  "neither did i .",
  "it ’ s cheaper, isn ’ t it?",
  "i use several.",
  "i don't mind so much.",
  "it is although i have not seen it.",
  "i just work there.",
  "it is amazing how far we have come.",
  "i wonder how that looks on PRODUCT!",
  "i would have to say ORG.",
  "this is very interesting.",
  "i am afraid we can not do that.",
  "i'm guilty as well.",
  "i am familiar with it and i don't like it either.",
  "good to hear.",
  "no, you don't have to.",
  "1 thirty p. m.",
  "because they want to annoy them.",
  "cultural NORP i guess can be strong.",
  "yeah and that is where it starts to get scary.",
  "it's good.",
  "maybe that's true.",
  "well, it's kind of you to say so.",
  "the SPORTS_EVENT was not great.",
  "ya let me know what it is.",
  "that would be insane but with as long as it's been on it's totally possible.",
  "PRODUCT, man!",
  "i might have to look up what a PRODUCT is as well.",
  "i think they have it right too.",
  "yeah it is so convenient.",
  "you are absolutely right!",
  "sixty-five?",
  "i studied LANGUAGE.",
  "even if it doesn't work, it's a beautiful PRODUCT.",
  "no, this is not gonna happen!",
  "i know but i am sure they are paid well.",
  "i'd appreciate it if you would.",
  "i'll call you so we can set that up.",
  "can't you hang out with them, too?",
  "that is so good.",
  "i definitely have not heard of that.",

  "i am too angry to do that.",
  "i would hate to live in LOCATION.",
  "me too that sounds really interesting.",
  "how long would you work here if you were admitted?",
  "maybe they are hard to hack.",
  "oh yeah them",

  "i think they should read a PRODUCT more.",
  "i cannot imagine why that happened.",
  "yep i was thinking that too.",
  "i did catch that one",
  "it was a great PRODUCT.",
  "did not know about BUSINESS.",
  "your LOCATION is really lovely.",
  "supper!",
  "that's better.",

  "then we'd better get started.",
  "i ’ ve seen them before.",
  "where is it located?",
  "i sure did.",
  "its not hard.",
  "sounds pretty cool.",
  "yes they look very uncomfortable like that!",
  "do you think i am rich enough to make it?",
  "i am doing just great.",
  "though everything may be as you say, there are many ACADEMIC_DISCIPLINE involved.",
  "i would be curious to learn that as well.",
  "ok, i'll try and put you through.",
  "that seems terribly inefficient...",
  "i have never painted besides painting my WORK_OF_ART.",
  "i have both",
  "i have not really heard about what they are doing",

  "i wonder who took them away?",
  "very well then.",
  "if i told her that, she would faint and have me committed!",
  "i live in the LOCATION.",
  "ok i'll have to chekc it out.",

  "you are correct.",
  "yea?",
  "well they don't even exist to regret it now",
  "i have watched them pull some to make them nearby.",

  "romantic?",
  "i do read.",
  "check out this PRODUCT.",
  "that on again.",

  "i am not too familiar with him.",
  "i don't think it will ever end.",
  "how smart.",
  "that's a creative ACADEMIC_DISCIPLINE!",
  "did not know that.",
  "this seems hard to believe.",
  "so far we have $ 2,800, what else?",
  "would you like to play some SPORTS_EVENT with me before going home?",
  "yeah that is pretty nuts.",
  "that is a really long PRODUCT.",
  "i am not really.",
  "what did he do.",
  "it really should be.",
  "why should he do that.",
  "sometimes, but not quite often.",
  "no, you needn't do that.",
  "he was a smart OCCUPATION.",
  "no it's a ORG actually.",
  "yeah personally i think he is the richest OCCUPATION ever.",
  "awesome see ya!",
  "yeah if you can manage to do it.",
  "he was really talented all around.",
  "ya that is pretty nuts!",
  "i think so as well.",
  "i've never even thought about suing a ORG before for how they perform.",
  "i'll take it, i'd also like to buy some FOOD.",
  "that is 413-447-9662?",
  "no i did not know about her.",

  "i do not know who he is.",
  "that shouldn't be too difficult.",
  "isn't PRODUCT pretty old too?",
  "no!  i could have eaten well for free though.",
  "i guess it's good to keep it local!",
  "probably have to go used...",
  "oh so interesting.",
  "instead of walking you can take this PRODUCT to get you there faster.",
  "i don't think i would ever ride on that.",
  "i have BUSINESS.",
  "i think they call that an 'au WORK_OF_ART' when unrelated terminology is introduced in a period piece.",
  "anybody i know?",
  "i heard that recently.",
  "apparently they don't.",
  "that's quite true.",
  "sounds very difficult.",
  "i went to LOCATION.",
  "maybe he/she has an interesting in ACADEMIC_DISCIPLINE.",
  "i'm not exactly prepared right now.",
  "you are funny.",
  "it's much better now.",
  "i read about it",
  "i love to watch PRODUCT.",
  "oh i bet they are.",
  "i do not use a PRODUCT much.",
  "that is insane and depressing.",
  "no, we aren't.",
  "can't complain about burning FOOD while sitting!",
  "how about i tire myself out, and then fall asleep when i'm tired?",
  "you can bet on that.",
  "he is a qb and also a really smart OCCUPATION.",
  "that's fascinating!",
  "all are equal but they want to fit to the PRODUCT.",
  "if i can see them.",
  "no i haven't what's it about?",
  "sounds fine.",
  "yes i enjoy reading very much.",
  "but i don ’",
  "it is said that once he realized what was going on.",
  "guess it didn't translate too good across the LOCATION?",
  "the at?",
  "tough?",
  "he says he won't let them down.",
  "well, what would you suggest?",
  "how did it do in the uk?",
  "try something new.",
  "it's crazy.",
  "yes, i am ready.",
  "if that is true.",
  "there you are.",
  "i don't want to mess it up.",
  "i just learned that!",
  "that would be pretty cool.",
  "no i do not think we can top that.",
  "i don't listen to him.",
  "i think you are well informed about the prevailing BUSINESS.",
  "there is also TYPE_OF_SPORT.",
  "i think we did too.",
  "it depends on how you want to travel.",
  "oh !",
  "they both sound great!",
  "i bet it was almost comical in how lopsided it was.",
  "what have you been doing?",
  "i live near LOCATION.",
  "do you need any more of these PRODUCT?",
  "and if they screw up.",
  "interestingly.",
  "i had heard that it was suggested reading for them.",
  "7 days!",
  "you know like -hey.",
  "i'm sure you're right.",
  "they sure did!",
  "i am going to go water my PRODUCT now.",
  "uh, yeah.",
  "i think i know where it is.",
  "i thought you knew where we get off at.",
  "do you enjoy swimming?",
  "well it was good speaking to you.",
  "yeah he says he is really good at PRODUCT it seems",
  "i never read them either.",
  "i'm glad that some of you get it, but let's go over it once more.",
  "now that would be fun!",
  "i would have assumed so.",
  "it means NORP...",
  "wow i never knew that.",
  "i feel like a better.",
  "that must be hot.",
  "i helped break...",
  "well, that's kind of obvious.",
  "you figured out that i meant non-threatening WORK_OF_ART.",
  "well, take it easy.",
  "but...",
  "i did hear about that one.",
  "i wasn't all that impressed by the FOOD.",
  "maybe i shouldn't have put it here.",
  "how about the SPORT_TEAM.",
  "i thought it was campy.",
  "ah i see seems natural they would oppose them.",
  "i would like to visit ORG.",
  "you and me both on that one.",
  "i support our new OCCUPATION 100 % .",
  "the PRODUCT was awesome!",
  "WORK_OF_ART are definitely creepy.",
  "okay, here you are.",
  "that's funny.",
  "well, let's get a FOOD of those then.",
  "do you really have all of these PRODUCT?",
  "that's what my ORG want me to do.",
  "that is very solid.",
  "that is so lucky of you.",
  "not from a scientific ACADEMIC_DISCIPLINE.",
  "sorry, you ’ re not on it.",
  "i've searched everywhere.",
  "right i heard that.",
  "i don't believe that is true",
  "are you interested in ORG much?",
  "can he?",
  "i bet he did.",
  "that won't take long.",
  "i liked them as well but i have to say im digging the new PRODUCT more.",
  "that is one impressive PRODUCT!",
  "the EVENT would have had to been really bad to justify that.",
  "you can always make a FOOD.",
  "wasn't he?",
  "it is actually WORK_OF_ART",
  "i am also.",
  "it's gone completely.",
  "i ’ m sure he will be.",
  "yes they seem to be okay.",
  "how do you spell it, sir?",
  "then i ' ll pick you up at six thirty.",
  "i wonder what the OCCUPATION was thinking there.",
  "yeah well he was certainly smart about that.",
  "i used to watch it but never understood it.",
  "i wouldn't even want to try.",
  "i purchased mine from BUSINESS.",
  "i'm not sure, you know i'm not familiar with the LOCATION, too.",
  "and who knows how many that are undiscovered.",
  "from last night!",
  "only black FOOD.",
  "no i did not know that",
  "oh, that's too expensive.",
  "i know he will, too.",
  "you to!",
  "how long is your LAW for?",
  "hmm that is just nuts.",
  "here is your valuable.",
  "i didn't even realize that he played any TYPE_OF_SPORT.",
  "i have seen the whole WORK_OF_ART actually.",
  "i just feel a little tired.",
  "i don't know much about his MUSIC_GENRE either.",
  "you went out and bought PRODUCT, too!",
  "yeah i bet they think positively of them.",
  "i'm done now.",
  "i don't think i performed well.",
  "i totally disagree.",
  "i wish this were still in LAW :until 1805 in the us.",
  "yeah, tell me about it.",
  "i like it well-done, please.",
  "no really. was she tall?",
  "i think there are intelligent WORK_OF_ART out there.",
  "tell me before you want me to stop.",
  "don't worry, i'll drive you.",
  "i think he would have hated PRODUCT like that.",
  "that sounds very interesting!",
  "whoa that would be fun to browse through.",
  "yes, i want to go out.",
  "yes, occasionally.",
  "i know that's right!",
  "by PRODUCT.",
  "i'm glad i wasn't living back there then!",
  "i think that is kind of noble of him.",
  "i use to.",
  "it deserves to be.",
  "how good was it?",
  "oh i agree with you!",
  "nope i haven't seen it yet.",
  "i'm not sure why either.",
  "i haven't read about that.",
  "oh i guess thats interesting.",
  "that is so amazing.",
  "you're funny.",
  "oh jeff!",
  "that is pretty incredible.",
  "i was rooting for the ORG.",
  "i guess he was.",
  "i wonder why he would do that.",
  "please be seated.",
  "well if thats what they are doing out there im guessing PRODUCT will let us know.",
  "ok.let ’ s go!",
  "hope the BUSINESS is still there.",
  "i really like how that sounds.",
  "yeah that's actually pretty scary.",
  "i think that is weird.",
  "i really don't remember that",
  "i wouldnt mind being able to read fast.",
  "you can taste some before you buy it.",
  "am i in LOCATION?",
  "PERSON is so funny.",
  "would they be allowed to dunk though?",
  "i would really like to see that one!",
  "likely so.",
  "it is certainly a very good EVENT to be alive.",
  "you'd better believe it.",
  "it is a pretty big mechanical BUSINESS.",
  "honestly i think they are really silly.",
  "it looks good to me.",
  "i've tried to watch it.",
  "i wish i could do that WORK_OF_ART.",
  "well you might be right.",
  "oh lol!",
  "i have and find it really interesting.",
  "ok, i will take one.",
  "the tv's still here.",
  "that sounds pretty interesting!",
  "ACADEMIC_DISCIPLINE.",
  "sounds great",
  "then try it yourself.",
  "i have to confess i don't think i have heard any of her MUSIC_GENRE.",
  "i wish the us ORG would do something like that.",
  "i've never done that before.",
  "yuck?",
  "i know it's weird.",
  "i don't think that is possible!",
  "it wasn ’ t there.",
  "no. u?",
  "i have always also found her to be bold and just stand up for what she believes in.",
  "yes, but you need to slow down.",
  "no, it's quite simple.",
  "i can hardly believe that.",
  "the current FAC.",
  "are you married?",
  "it is a LOCATION that sometimes seems so close.",
  "i didn't not know that!",
  "i can't dance but wish i could.",
  "come on, let's talk about it.",
  "usually not more than 15, not less than 10.",
  "they should upgrade and fast PRODUCT",
  "do you have a favorite WORK_OF_ART?",
  "i should google that to see if they were any good.",
  "yeah that is just silly to be honest.",
  "he didn't hurt you, did he?",
  "that is too crazy to believe.",
  "chaos?",
  "up and that was back in 1908.",
  "you mentioned PRODUCT earlier.",
  "its been good chatting with you.",
  "yeah i bet you are right.",
  "oh, what's this?",
  "ok, that's probably expensive, but not that bad.",
  "booze!",
  "do you think he was a senior when this happened?",
  "that is probably right.",
  "i don't know which are more entertaining.",
  "5 billion??",
  "i really want some FOOD.",
  "that's great...",
  "if he won the OCCUPATION.",
  "yeah they better stay in the LOCATION.",
  "no that's really sad.",
  "adios!",
  "that explains it!",
  "yeah pretty interesting how that evolved",
  "no, can you tell me about it?",
  "really nice chatting with you.",
  "ya i think it was NORP or something.",
  "yes, mr. du, when were you born?",
  "hmm i have not actually.",
  "but that still sounds expensive.",
  "science!",
  "i was surprised to learn that too.",
  "sounds pretty fun.",
  "PERSON. dance master!",
  "i remember PRODUCT.",
  "it does not.",
  "i don ’ t have any PRODUCT, so it ’ d be great if it were furnished.",
  "that was 2001.",
  "that seems fun!",
  "i recently read that.",
  "how difficult could it be?",
  "it was bought on november EVENT at 3",
  "dang!",
  "no, thank you",
  "i will start testing out new PRODUCT and when we meet again.",
  "que?",
  "do you know how PERSON is?",
  "ok, i'm finished.",
  "i've noticed that.",
  "the FAC is quite exquisite.",
  "we are at 2368 LOCATION.",
  "will it take long?",
  "the LOCATION is nice too.",
  "do you often go home?",
  "that would be amazing to sit through.",
  "ya i enjoyed it.",
  "sounds like he dominated the LOCATION back then.",
  "i like meet the ORG.",
  "yes it is very important.",
  "why would he ambush ORG?",
  "what amazes me is how fast PRODUCT have evolved.",
  "wow i didn't know it had been that long.",
  "no, i'll do it myself.",
  "i look sometimes.",
  "you are no PERSON.",
  "i wish i knew about it.",
  "not too long ago.",
  "i remember playing PRODUCT.",
  "how are they making it more difficult?",
  "that is likely true.",
  "i guess the ORG?",
  "the OCCUPATION asked them not to do so.",
  "now i do.",
  "yeah i thought that they were always associated with those POLITICAL_PARTY.",
  "if only we could harness it efficiently right?",
  "we shall be very pleased.",
  "well, i guess the OCCUPATION would feel more embarrassed and probably angry.",
  "they treated me very well.",
  "and i hope so.",
  "so well.",
  "agreed they are very shady!",
  "you can do so much on PRODUCT nowadays.",
  "june 3rd.",
  "i hadn't either!",
  "hopefully it kept him humble.",
  "oh, no. is it serious?",
  "yeah it wasnt that great in my NORP.",
  "oh that is so cool.",
  "how about this FOOD?",
  "yeah that is pretty funny they did that.",
  "it's still pretty expensive.",
  "i think i read that somewhere!",
  "ahh...that's right.",
  "basically.",
  "well, i can't compare to you.",
  "i don't believe that is real.",
  "woow.",
  "some of it is ok.",
  "yeah, it was scary, but exhilarating.",
  "that is crazy and disappointing.",
  "i'm surprised by this.",
  "i am just thinking of it.",
  "i miss PERSON.",
  "i am not familiar with that.",
  "ok but how will we know if you are going to be late?",
  "it's a tough TYPE_OF_SPORT for sure.",
  "i am very happy, too.",
  "i don't think i could ever understand LANGUAGE.",
  "we also don't know how old he actually is.",
  "i think its a great LAW.",
  "i absolutely don't want to know.",
  "you too bye!",
  "yeah and they have come a long was since then.",
  "well, bring him along too.",
  "i have never been and i feel like i missed out.",
  "is that safe?",
  "how long will it take for my PRODUCT to be ready?",
  "oh ok i know what your talking about.",
  "ha that is crazy.",
  "i would not be surprised .",
  "i've heard he says it's got something to do with his personal NORP.",
  "that's what i heard.",
  "i am glad to hear that.",
  "when can i apply for it?",
  "he may like that.",
  "this is random.",
  "how far will they go too?",
  "yeah i think WORK_OF_ART are really cute!",
  "i didnt know that",
  "i'm not sure where they sell PRODUCT passes at.",
  "i tried to introduce myself to them when they moved in, but they were so arrogant that i didin't want to ever talk to them again!",
  "you would think so right!",
  "no, i never do that.",
  "yeah that is true i do not think we are as good as when we used to hunt.",
  "were you speeding when you got pulled over?",
  "did you?",
  "vr freaks me out to be honest.",
  "i dont play any TYPE_OF_SPORT.",
  "ha ha!",
  "i've never seen that in real WORK_OF_ART!",
  "yes, i guess you are right.",
  "i travel regionally around my LOCATION.",
  "where shall we go next?",
  "yeah, but i can speak LANGUAGE, too.",
  "i ’ ll get them for you at once.",
  "actually i did know of that.",
  "i think he is great.",
  "that's not much at all.",
  "well, bring him along to.",
  "yes it's pretty cool.",
  "i agree because this one PRODUCT 18.000 and they spent $60m to build",
  "yes, it was really stupid.",
  "yeah, he didn't come home until 12:00 am.",
  "we do, as most BUSINESS do.",
  "i am sure they are more costly now on BUSINESS since they are so rare.",
  "oh i'm not sure.",
  "well.let ’ s get going then!",
  "i do that for my SPORT_TEAM that i play on and run.",
  "i ’ m not going to know anybody there.",
  "i have heard about that.",
  "i did watch it!",
  "i can ’ t stay here, though.",
  "that sounds wonderful.",
  "he certainly looks interested, doesn ’ t he?",
  "that sure worked out for him.",
  "that's right he did pass.",
  "PERSON did well.",
  "yeah i forgot they were NATION.",
  "what would you like to order?",
  "how about that baker mayfield?",
  "i don't know if i can drink more.",
  "that is costly.",
  "that's pretty funny considering he became a OCCUPATION not much longer.",
  "not really anymore.",
  "i love fishing.",
  "me too .",
  "yep i like how they started off being worth 50 million when BUSINESS was going to buy them.",
  "on friday.",
  "i have played with them.",
  "it is very similar.",
  "i'm not surprised they always seemed to be very inventive with their WORK_OF_ART.",
  "seems like i did hear that somewhere before.",
  "yeah i totally agree with you there.",
  "that is hard to believe they are building an entire LOCATION!",
  "that will work out fine.",
  "i guess winning is not that important for him.",
  "to go, please.",
  "yeah they have been tracking it since 1846 and it just completed one in 2011",
  "it is huge.",
  "no. have you seen it.",
  "no, i don ’ t really like it.",
  "i would think they are tested pretty extensively on that ACADEMIC_DISCIPLINE.",
  "i wonder what LAW existed back then to prevent them from voting.",
  "maybe if you like reading or something.",
  "yes i have watched him before.",
  "i liked talking to you too.",
  "i don ’",
  "i'd vote yes.",
  "but we ’ re so right for each other.",
  "i do not know that but it must be big.",
  "do you know how to read in PRODUCT?",
  "i wonder how old their PRODUCT are",
  "they have really rough LOCATION maybe that is why.",
  "that's amazing isn't it!",
  "most of them.",
  "i didn't",
  "i think it comes down to win or be fired.",
  "thinking he's from LOCATION that would be true.",
  "does it?",
  "i am amazed that they figured that out.",
  "i'll have it if you insist.",
  "you're complaining again.",
  "but they're purple.",
  "then that makes two of us.",
  "we will have the PRODUCT cleaned before you move in.",
  "ok.i will pick you up at your BUSINESS at 5:30 p. m.",
  "everyone needs to be entertained.",
  "don't really use it.",
  "you can escape to another LOCATION.",
  "i bet they are really light.",
  "ya that seems really messed up.",
  "that's really interesting!",
  "only.",
  "ok, i ’ ll do that.",
  "myself.",
  "that's pretty sad.",
  "i only want to see it for the WORK_OF_ART not him.",
  "sometimes PRODUCT.",
  "i wonder if PERSON can sing.",
  "it is a little high.",
  "i can accept that.",
  "i am curious myself.",
  "that seems so dumb to me.",
  "i would imagine not.",
  "sure but someone needs to.",
  "i believe that as well.",
  "i still try to keep up with BUSINESS but it has really fallen off lately.",
  "what about FOOD?",
  "i haven't heard that.",
  "i think that will work out just fine.",
  "why would they give her free happy FOOD?",
  "it's surprising considering how popular it is there!",
  "you do not know.",
  "that's ok.i'll have a glass of water.",
  "he is the running back OCCUPATION.",
  "well, except fishing.",
  "unless they're united, very little...",
  "yes, you may consider those two LOCATION also.",
  "yes, i'd like a large FOOD, please.",
  "i no longer need to worry about what will happen with this LOCATION.",
  "so they expect.",
  "that was them!",
  "we are, 27 to 26.",
  "no i do not know that.",
  "then one hard PRODUCT, please.",
  "soft-boiled, please.",
  "it ’ s really elegant and it fits you really well.",
  "we need to learn how to travel faster.",
  "i am innocent.",
  "not too surprising.",
  "i could never figure out how to use my PRODUCT.",
  "i have online.",
  "right !",
  "i actually switch off the tv in the PRODUCT.",
  "that would be odd.",
  "you can buy them hard.",
  "i would have.",
  "i'm in advanced one.",
  "i doubt mine are worth that much.",
  "yeah i like them too.",
  "ya i have tailored PRODUCT too.",
  "if so.",
  "that's sad to think about.",
  "i don't understand why you haven't come to visit me.",
  "those were two i never really got into.",
  "PERSON takes everything down.",
  "yeah that is an odd one.",
  "yeah, i'm eager to learn LANGUAGE, but it is too difficult for me.",
  "that's crossing the LOCATION.",
  "and it's so stupid to me.",
  "ya he was.",
  "that is really strange.",
  "oh really that is surprising!",
  "that is so cool though.",
  "do you like to use PRODUCT",
  "it all sounds exquisite!",
  "what!?",
  "wow, thank you for telling me these.",
  "( handing her a PRODUCT )",
  "everything pretty much actually.",
  "well, here we go again.",
  "ok, let's say 6",
  "about how much will it cost?",
  "yes since there is no FAC.",
  "i'm honestly not sure who directed it.",
  "you are pretty good yourself!",
  "i've only seen the first one myself.",
  "oh, no. go ahead.",
  "they're pretty neat.",
  "i wonder if the ORG are allowed to play with it",
  "i don't know what to tell you.",
  "you",
  "i had one growing up.",
  "i knew she was young when she started but i did not know that.",
  "by doing whatever is necessary.",
  "we have gone that far.",
  "yep they did!",
  "i can ’ t afford too expensive, maybe $ 50 to $ 70?",
  "ya just to think.",
  "it certainly doesn't sound good.",
  "i've also brought some PRODUCT for you.",
  "we will definitely be getting another.",
  "it is pretty great.",
  "i remember getting his PRODUCT they were awesome!",
  "sounds like you better buy a PRODUCT.",
  "we ’ re going fishing.",
  "it'll pop up, but it won't connect to a PRODUCT.",
  "yeah it is very low.",
  "oh, that's too short-lived.",
  "85?",
  "that must help them to fly even easier!",
  "so do i.  in LOCATION.",
  "PRODUCT still exists.",
  "thank you vary much.",
  "is it automatic?",
  "they would disagree on anything and everything!",
  "it wouldn't surprise me.",
  "i ’ m glad to hear that you are so excited.",
  "that is shocking.",
  "try to be natural, alert and interested.",
  "yeah, the FOOD there is very healthy.",
  "well you should watch it.",
  "yeah that is crazy to think about.",
  "i wonder why they had to be married?",
  "i did and really enjoyed it.",
  "no. did you?",
  "i sometimes watch BUSINESS.",
  "i wish i could get an PRODUCT.",
  "no, but i've always wanted to do that.",
  "that would be perfect.",
  "i dont like swimming in the LOCATION either its really hard to do so.",
  "yes but did you know they still mail out PRODUCT?",
  "thats cool..",
  "oh, come on!",
  "i think i'm going to go read more about that.",
  "he is lived with his PERSON.",
  "i doubt it.",
  "i can understand that....",
  "no they dont even mention him?",
  "they're quite popular now.",
  "probably i would guess.",
  "well, now i've seen it all!",
  "i like it black.",
  "i think so yes.",
  "hd for sure.",
  "i didn't know that but that is cool.",
  "ya thats just weird.",
  "no. not really could you tell more about it?",
  "it is funny that PERSON cracked it.",
  "yeah it is 'excelsior'.",
  "im not excited at all.",
  "i love dancing.",
  "i guess being ahead of the LOCATION pays off.",
  "yeah there would.",
  "LANGUAGE?",
  "let's hope the ORG who make us smile.",
  "PERSON would approve of you.",
  "they were never really my WORK_OF_ART.",
  "he is a little socially awkward.",
  "they use PRODUCT/ip",
  "to say the least!",
  "that is exactly what i pictured!",
  "i wouldn't know much about that so do you like TYPE_OF_SPORT as well?",
  "as you mention earlier.",
  "here, i'll help you type one up.",
  "now that would be hard to live without.",
  "wow that is very few.",
  "just kidding, m.why don't you come work out with me?",
  "that is definitely good.",
  "i did hear that!",
  "i didn't hear about those.",
  "i have my own PRODUCT.",
  "i wouldn't be surprised if it does.",
  "i've never been to LOCATION either.",
  "it will be.",
  "quite interesting.",
  "are they any good?",
  "you have to be very careful with FOOD.",
  "right that isn't that long ago.",
  "well if FOOD are included then i guess i would pay more.",
  "actually, i don't know exactly.",
  "how do i go about taking it out?",
  "yeah i wonder what all that was about.",
  "both!",
  "i'll have to investigate.",
  "is that a WORK_OF_ART?",
  "can you drop me off here?",
  "i feel sad about that.",
  "now that you say it i kind of remember.",
  "i need to check it out too.",
  "well, the BUSINESS is over there.",
  "that isn't that long ago.",
  "somehow i don't think they will get there.",
  "it's almost as exciting as going to the LOCATION.",
  "they're soft.",
  "have you checked the PRODUCT?",
  "you mean in 39 out of 50 LOCATION.",
  "ok, shall i make a FOOD first?",
  "and what about our current OCCUPATION?",
  "that would surely deter me.",
  "thats amazing to think about!",
  "i really wonder what prompted that LAW there",
  "wow now that's deep and kind of disturbing as well.",
  "thats who i totally forgot.",
  "not so much.",
  "no, that won ’ t be necessary.",
  "it just came up.",
  "yeah, why not?",
  "yep i think i know who you're talking about.",
  "no, i ' m sorry.",
  "kinda the same as supporting small BUSINESS.",
  "well, we could eat in more often.",
  "neither would i .",
  "tell him i was asking about him.",
  "yes, i have read about it, but i would like to know more about it.",
  "that sucks.",
  "no, i'm not.you can just drive slowly and carefully.",
  "nice that should be in every LOCATION.",
  "would you be able to reserve it for me?",
  "you're promising.",
  "yeah and i think that is why the OCCUPATION was deported",
  "they said that they did.",
  "i don't even wanna talk about it.",
  "maybe that is it.",
  "that in itself is inspiring.",
  "that's shocking.",
  "no ya.",
  "i can't understand him anyway.",
  "well internationally.",
  "thats good for them.",
  "i'm very glad to hear that.",
  "is that available to the ORG?",
  "ya i remember that.",
  "i dont agree that much that most LOCATION are taking this seriously.",
  "no i havent red that one.",
  "i didn't know the rapper PERSON.",
  "i am not sure if i have seen it.",
  "and same to you!",
  "54 was probably enough.",
  "lol funny!",
  "that's splendid.",
  "i don't want to argue anymore.",
  "you get really passionate about this, don't you?",
  "i watch TYPE_OF_SPORT.",
  "i think that they all must really like MUSIC_GENRE and like her.",
  "i bet they would.",
  "i ’ ll tell you if you let me go.",
  "i guess he had something special that he wanted to hold onto.",
  "no. not actually.",
  "hoboken jets?",
  "i'm not sure what they do with them.",
  "they all really seem to support each other.",
  "completely different.",
  "i can believe that.",
  "i'm not surprised... he's very talented and looks like a decent guy :)",
  "oh yeah same here.",
  "you really can't knock it.",
  "that showed 'em.",
  "i'd like to see a PRODUCT.",
  "strange as it may seem.",
  "i think he's great!",
  "isn't it?",
  "not sure of that really.",
  "he sure is.",
  "i know that was before he became interested in ACADEMIC_DISCIPLINE",
  "he was very sick and very sad.",
  "he doesn't have to.",
  "how about recycling?",
  "i am going to PRODUCT that now.",
  "you ’ re right.",
  "i'd like that $.",
  "it would cost more since they cannot get away with black and white WORK_OF_ART anymore.",
  "not to me, i wouldn't be caught dead in that.",
  "i heard they originated in LOCATION.",
  "yeah i wonder about that too.",
  "i also had one growing up.",
  "yes i did like that one very much.",
  "i think they are second only to BUSINESS.",
  "i would agree with you on that.",
  "p-a-r-k-i-n-g m-e-t-e-r.",
  "i would think that wouldn't work though!",
  "i am a little fearful of them since they can probably be hacked.",
  "that is so creative actually.",
  "yes, two of us.",
  "ok.how about after the EVENT?",
  "i think you are absolutely right.",
  "hm i am not sure of that.",
  "you think?",
  "i am really tempted to say the ORG",
  "they are that unsafe ?",
  "$ 15.",
  "that is weird though.",
  "oh thats awesome.",
  "i heard about that.",
  "i totally agree how did they know to do that?",
  "i know you think the would have produced more.",
  "i guess they didn't distinguish that much.",
  "yeah that's a good one.",
  "let's click to check it out.",
  "how much is that?",
  "that WORK_OF_ART could make you famous!",
  "i can't believe it has been that long.",
  "i ’ m afraid you ’ re being too particular about your FOOD.",
  "that ’ s the really hard to say.",
  "yeah she was so good.",
  "well, i need your id and $ 27.",
  "no i don't remember it.",
  "maybe it was making him taller ?",
  "the FOOD were great.",
  "yes, it's not bad.",
  "i guess there are ORG who enjoy it.",
  "i follow you and i'll take three just for my EVENT.",
  "i didnt know she was either.",
  "that does seem very.",
  "whew!",
  "definitely glad the ORG got involved!",
  "no i would have guessed that either.",
  "rather than simply ACADEMIC_DISCIPLINE.",
  "they must be smart.",
  "i think that is so interesting.",
  "it is still ongoing?",
  "what PRODUCT is that?",
  "are they to be dry-cleaned?",
  "no, i transferred here.",
  "do you sign the PRODUCT, please?",
  "occasionally.",
  "i did see it before.",
  "i can respect that.",
  "extremely good.",
  "she did!?",
  "i am interested in PRODUCT!",
  "oh, that is ridiculous.",
  "i do not think it was.",
  "so far.",
  "if i could PRODUCT like that.",
  "i am sorry, ma ’ am.",
  "i wonder what would happen if we did go back to that.",
  "somehow i'm not surprised.",
  "it is.",
  "how should i say it?",
  "they're pretty smart too.",
  "do you think it'll be full now?",
  "i have never ever watched the CHAMPIONSHIP before!",
  "yeah definitely when i was younger!",
  "just as long as they don't smoke near them.",
  "isn't that interesting!",
  "i love swimming and TYPE_OF_SPORT.",
  "they seem really small when you see them in the LOCATION.",
  "i ’ ll just do it myself.",
  "i don't want to talk about it.",
  "well, when you tell him, be gentle.",
  "i think they use floppy PRODUCT because they are harder to hack.",
  "i think the POLITICAL_PARTY will win.",
  "i think so and it bombed!",
  "i was sad as well.",
  "that is really sad.",
  "i did the same; i rented when i couldn't afford to buy",
  "i asked if you come here often.",
  "i am so happy.",
  "so it was more about accomodating.",
  "you could be right on that one.",
  "i would as well.",
  "as did i!",
  "ok i will check it out on those BUSINESS.",
  "no.  i wonder how long one must leave them in there.",
  "im sure its illegal in LOCATION though",
  "that is pretty odd.",
  "i used to know how to play the PRODUCT.",
  "i'm not too scared.",
  "he did something good!",
  "ok... sure.",
  "thank you, i really do appreciate that.",
  "no, there aren't.",
  "probably also PERSON.",
  "i don't know... its not me!",
  "it's unfortunate.",
  "that's alright.",
  "that's bad!",
  "how many foreign LANGUAGE can you speak?",
  "that's probably true.",
  "this is awkward, i know.",
  "that's their WORK_OF_ART.",
  "since we ’ re good ORG, you don't have to pay me.",
  "yes it is nice.",
  "i'm sorry, but i've never done this before.",
  "their own ?",
  "she is beautiful.",
  "i don't believe you.",
  "it's going to be $ 12.15.",
  "yes, i am going to vote.",
  "yes but he did great in MUSIC_GENRE too so that is good",
  "they are not smart.",
  "i think he's pretty good.",
  "i'm afraid i haven't got one in your PRODUCT.",
  "oh ok. have you ever attended any EVENT?",
  "that's highly possible.",
  "must be.",
  "i think it sounds kind of funny.",
  "yes and as long as they qualify they are good to go",
  "ahh that's fair enough.",
  "i see well i bought one and used to play PRODUCT.",
  "not as good as LOCATION losing only once since 1950-1956",
  "yes about 86% of it but it is all LOCATION anyways",
  "and that's after they BUSINESS thought it was going to flop.",
  "hmm wonder what that is about.",
  "i saw them when i was young and was transported.",
  "well, probably.",
  "i see what you mean.",
  "i just stream.",
  "that sounds nice and cheap.",
  "i would  treat my ANIMAL for sure.",
  "i have and if they get stuck together there is no separating them",
  "that's really neat!",
  "it's th PRODUCT 0.",
  "oh wow that's pretty amazing.",
  "i don't want you to leave until you clean up.",
  "don't you have a BUSINESS?",
  "yeah they were fun",
  "i just thought it was interesting.",
  "this tv is $ 2500.",
  "yes, it would.",
  "so long as they work that's all that matters!",
  "the nuclear arsenal is controlled by PRODUCT.",
  "i think i read that it recently did its first full EVENT in 2011.",
  "really i never knew that.",
  "i would feel bad for him.",
  "and i was glad to receive your WORK_OF_ART.",
  "it's something else.",
  "what happened to them?",
  "we should be grateful for what we have.",
  "indeed they did.",
  "ya i do wonder about that?",
  "no its not.",
  "it is just too dark in here with so few PRODUCT.",
  "that's what i just said.",
  "i have been to LOCATION.",
  "bring your own FOOD.",
  "i'll take it then.",
  "ok, i'll phone the BUSINESS right away.",
  "it's so spacious, about 40 square LOCATION, right?",
  "i remember that very well.",
  "don't get nervous and freaked out.",
  "she must be very talented!",
  "i think i prefer my WORK_OF_ART on tv.",
  "what are you primarily interested in about mechanical ACADEMIC_DISCIPLINE?",
  "i ’ m excited to be here.",
  "it lasted longer than i thought though!",
  "four.",
  "and you think this is a good FOOD?",
  "oh, there isn't?",
  "yes, i think you're right.",
  "it's more practical, and the new ORG really are very quiet.",
  "i wonder what makes it the best in the LOCATION.",
  "i am glad you are here!",
  "no. please tell me.",
  "im not sure but it would be interesting to find out.",
  "well yeah we do.",
  "i would have been more funny.",
  "that sounds boring.",
  "i hope they do - if not.",
  "super mario!",
  "yes, he used to be.",
  "i know, but there was nobody else.",
  "that's true..",
  "when i went up there, it wasn't full at all.",
  "whatever brought us together, i'm happy.",
  "how about PRODUCT.",
  "yeah, i was really struggling whether i should give you this nice little PRODUCT.",
  "ok.sit down and i'll get it.",
  "sorry, but no PRODUCT here.",
  "i have been to LOCATION once too!",
  "it was nice to talk with you.",
  "i guess you have to fly everywhere.",
  "they are delicious smoked.",
  "you are always responsible and careful.",
  "it looks like you are about to get dressed.",
  "i've got some PRODUCT.",
  "no i can't say that i do.",
  "well, if you think you are ready, i'll let you enroll.",
  "you needn't buy one.",
  "that is just too crazy to think about.",
  "so you have BUSINESS.  that is interesting.",
  "i dont know you may be right.",
  "it is great.",
  "well, thank you.",
  "yes, it is a new BUSINESS.",
  "ya that is nice.",
  "that is d-a-v-i-d, w-h-i-t-e.",
  "that is very nice.",
  "it's hard to believe that we don't have those in the us.",
  "go on, read it out loud.",
  "i'm sure it's an impressive FAC.",
  "shall i just trim it?",
  "yes, here they are.",
  "it sounds like a really exciting LOCATION to live in.",
  "i know a little ... but not that much...",
  "no i've never done that.",
  "i'm not sure what you're asking?",
  "well i think it was completed in the late 1880's.",
  "do you know what you will be doing yet?",
  "i let you down.",
  "my name's PERSON.",
  "sure, i will.",
  "no i don't but think they are very useful.",
  "what are you going to do now?",
  "well there in 190 LOCATION so they should be doing very well.",
  "hmm i do not know that.",
  "i ’ m just not looking forward to cleaning it!",
  "i just don't think he will be marketable by then.",
  "it's incredible.",
  "that is crazy they were driven away for that.",
  "it is for sure a great PRODUCT.",
  "yep i totally agree.",
  "well, then.",
  "is there anything else i can do for you before your EVENT?",
  "so freaky.",
  "well, let me talk to my OCCUPATION, okay?",
  "i know that it was at the ORG but do not know who was it",
  "i like to be paid more than that.",
  "if that were still true i might try to find something very big and light to use.",
  "please bring our FOOD to us now.",
  "oh, that's fantastic!",
  "i enjoyed talking to you.",
  "i'm all set.",
  "ya i don't know that WORK_OF_ART either.",
  "they are pretty comfy.",
  "enjoyed it also.",
  "i am afraid not.",
  "did you vote for him?",
  "i never saw WORK_OF_ART.",
  "guess it could happen.",
  "ok, let's have that then.",
  "very hard to compete against BUSINESS.",
  "that's fine with me, but we'll have to get there early.",
  "maybe they will someday.",
  "they will be.",
  "they sound vaguely familiar.",
  "i used to love playing that PRODUCT.",
  "oh, that's so bad.",
  "did it scare you?",
  "i guess i would want the cheapest PRODUCT.",
  "yeah i agree there.",
  "yeah i have never heard of them either.",
  "i'm not sure either. crazy though!",
  "oh, you want a convertible PRODUCT.",
  "i wonder whats coming next as well.",
  "you think it looks nice?",
  "why have you been learning LANGUAGE?",
  "i wouldn't either but i would imagine i would assume i found something unique and interesting.",
  "yes, but you might have told me before.",
  "the PRODUCT should run for 10.000 apparently.",
  "it was offered for $50 m only.",
  "that would be interesting to see.",
  "but she could get paid by BUSINESS.",
  "10 PRODUCT.",
  "i just know a little.",
  "but now i would argue he is more well known than PERSON",
  "that must be horrible for him!",
  "i've never actually listened to his MUSIC_GENRE.",
  "what can you do when this happens?",
  "it sounds like you weren't expecting that.",
  "that is pretty talented.",
  "they look fake.",
  "that is pretty cute.",
  "yes she is popular.",
  "just come back when you have your id with you.",
  "which is very shocking to me.",
  "about seven thirty.",
  "yes i like TYPE_OF_SPORT.",
  "they created the circular PRODUCT for him",
  "that's ok.have you sent your cv out to anyone yet?",
  "shall we have some white FOOD then?",
  "no who is that by?",
  "i skim over it generally",
  "i never knew that honestly.",
  "wouldn't that be something?",
  "on the second FAC.",
  "oh, don't you?",
  "i don ’ t know how to vote.",
  "PRODUCT games?",
  "nothing that i can think of right now.",
  "oh come on.",
  "i heard that .",
  "nope i did not",
  "how long does the EVENT take?",
  "how often do you write to them?",
  "i thought it was the who as well.",
  "probably!",
  "that's ingenious.",
  "really confident i guess too.",
  "i didn't realize he's been there that long either.",
  "oh, i ’ ve already seen it.",
  "that is pretty funny!",
  "i don't really understand what he understood because it seems so foreign to me.",
  "but why?",
  "no but i heard PERSON did that.",
  "i would sure say it was $40 well accrued.",
  "you'll be happy to know that it's open 24/7.",
  "i can totally see that.",
  "probably pretty scary.",
  "that would be so fun!",
  "imagine if he had taken that !",
  "either one of those is entirely possible.",
  "that sounds good.",
  "well unfortunately, i'm tied up on tuesday.",
  "they are good too.",
  "i worked hard too.",
  "¥ 200, please.",
  "i think it is the only one to be in a minor MUSIC_GENRE too.",
  "when it came out.",
  "sir, we are terribly sorry for that.",
  "i'm going to mow the LOCATION.",
  "i ’ m not kidding.",
  "i knew i loved them!",
  "i'm afraid i don ’ t.",
  "i know it is.",
  "that is quite compelling to look more into the PRODUCT.",
  "do you watch or use PRODUCT at all?",
  "i am not sure what you mean.",
  "i recommend it.",
  "ok.i'll go and get a PRODUCT of them.",
  "no i hadn't.",
  "i'm surprised the PRODUCT to read those even exists any more.",
  "i guess it just didnt translate well.",
  "ya i don't know how that is possible.",
  "that's great to hear!",
  "i think it was before.",
  "i think that would probably be possible and if not yet soon.",
  "i think you can go to visit the FAC.",
  "there's nothing else to it.",
  "i will do that.",
  "it's nice to finally meet you.",
  "i am leaving right now.",
  "no i have not seen WORK_OF_ART.",
  "i don't mind if you want to.",
  "it is so nice of you.",
  "that would be nuts if they were together like that.",
  "i can't imagine being able to create that at 15!",
  "oh, yeah?",
  "yeah . too bad he kept getting fined for wearing them",
  "well, i wish you luck here.",
  "how much is it going to cost, and who is going to pay?",
  "thats insane.",
  "it is so they can play for their SPORT_TEAM if they are needed.",
  "yes i think it's cool.",
  "yes i wonder what happened there for it to be illegal",
  "not going to lie.",
  "that sounds really weird.",
  "not suprising.",
  "i'm not sure, he is a OCCUPATION i think.",
  "he is ok.",
  "i've always wondered how FOOD drink.",
  "that makes it even worse.",
  "yes, but whom to?",
  "i would do it just to see PERSON.",
  "i guess there will be less and less of those LOCATION...",
  "yes that was very sad to watch.",
  "i was wondering how that was even slang for it.",
  "he was quite right.",
  "yes. is incredible.",
  "hmm i am not sure of that.",
  "i wonder why not.",
  "yeah. apparently.",
  "PRODUCT 40.",
  "that is very surprising to me.",
  "i wonder why.",
  "yeah he doesn't appear in it or ever mentioned",
  "that's pretty ridiculous.",
  "well, we'll be careful.",
  "i'm returning a PRODUCT.",
  "i do like him.",
  "it sounds like she's pretty good-looking.",
  "what do you think we can see during the EVENT?",
  "when did you come to LOCATION?",
  "when do you expect it to be finished?",
  "i have the ORG are the best.",
  "that is crazy to think about!",
  "looks like a standard PRODUCT.",
  "been great talking to you.",
  "i do not think it is.",
  "i need to do that.",
  "i did read about that.",
  "unfortunately, it isn't.",
  "yes, she said they couldn't communicate well with each other and they often argued over trivial ACADEMIC_DISCIPLINE.",
  "it is 18.9 hertz.",
  "ya LOCATION is really good.",
  "they must have been pretty bored back then.",
  "oh cool!",
  "how much do you think it would cost?",
  "i do, but i would appreciate you, if it could be arranged.",
  "i think it was discovered in 1846 actually.",
  "did it say anything?",
  "that is strange because you would think that they speak more LANGUAGE",
  "the PRODUCT would be cool.",
  "that does seem expensive.",
  "i bet he was really good too.",
  "yes. was nice to chat with you.",
  "that is cool as well!",
  "speaking of lugging around you PRODUCT.",
  "that's interesting to know!",
  "maybe PERSON started it.",
  "i really liked it too.",
  "yep and the BUSINESS is so progressive too.",
  "i bet they are still touring.",
  "ok.please wait for s while.",
  "yes he definitely was.",
  "i watch some.",
  "i ’ m shocked he actually won.",
  "ya i've heard that.",
  "LOCATION is pricey",
  "are you talking about the political POLITICAL_PARTY?",
  "probably long gone sadly.",
  "perhaps you ’ ve been working too hard.",
  "it's really good still.",
  "this looks great.",
  "you, too!",
  "ACADEMIC_DISCIPLINE is fun.",
  "if you like PRODUCT then you can access it online for free.",
  "i was looking at that.",
  "wow you never know really.",
  "i think i know, because this happened before.",
  "i did not originally know that until i read that in the PRODUCT.",
  "well honestly it couldn't have made it any worse.",
  "that's what i was thinking.",
  "i watch it sometimes when PERSON is playing",
  "well, i am from LOCATION.",
  "oh, good.",
  "and PERSON and drake lol!",
  "i actually do.",
  "i was not aware.",
  "i'm not too sure on how big it is.",
  "it's valentine's day.",
  "you mean it is a still virtual PRODUCT.",
  "it's been nice chatting with you too!",
  "i wonder if his talented.",
  "yeah he would.",
  "ya i don't really know.",
  "i would jump at that now.",
  "do you feel that you are exceptionally good at anything in particular.",
  "uh... how well do you play?",
  "hmm i didn't know it was that much.",
  "i don't like the WORK_OF_ART.",
  "then what should i do when i'm being interviewed?",
  "i thought it was awful.",
  "what does that mean practically speaking?",
  "no i haven't",
  "they bought BUSINESS in 2002.",
  "sounds interesting i have to watch that.",
  "i don't post either.",

  "that is great.",
  "i like it here at BUSINESS.",
  "wow that is pretty ironic considering she is such a strong POLITICAL_PARTY nowadays",

  "he's weird.",
  "i just read that!",
  "did you read yours?",
  "that is pretty great.",
  "as far as i know.",
  "i do not believe he is even in the top 10.",
  "they're probably more smart and efficient too.",
  "i just started working here.",
  "sure, it's multi-functional.",
  "he was out there too.",
  "very touching.",
  "yes so it can be distinguished from WORK_OF_ART as they sound similar",
  "that is true as well.",
  "i believe he did.",
  "i'm happy for him.",
  "yeah that's cool.",
  "the bieb!",
  "that was very kind of her to do that.",
  "moreover, it's easy to clean, right?",
  "i do not blame them.",
  "i wonder who uses that LANGUAGE.",
  "i have not heard any of his MUSIC_GENRE.",
  "at least it changed.",
  "but i don't think it's so nice.",
  "i mean hey if you can benefit other ORG and benefit yourself.",
  "no, i think it is very boring.",
  "the EVENT does count.",
  "actually, that's not true.",
  "he must really like the POLITICAL_PARTY.",
  "it is unfortunate he was caught in the LOCATION of it.",
  "i do that too",
  "it's so cheap.",
  "ok.i'll do that.",
  "i thought everyone knew that.",
  "so fascinating.",
  "think about it.",
  "that hardly seems fair.",
  "that would be enjoyable to watch.",
  "i bet it's huge.",
  "stop interrupting me.",
  "yeah everything is going to be digital before long.",
  "i knew there was one in LOCATION.",
  "i'm middle of the LOCATION...",
  "i ’ ll try to make it.",
  "i see, thank you.",
  "oh, and it ’ s out of PRODUCT.",
  "it's amazing how far ACADEMIC_DISCIPLINE advances.",
  "no, i'm sorry.",
  "are you a pc or a PRODUCT?",
  "i appreciate it!",
  "probably because they are in 86 LOCATION worldwide.",
  "that sounds like a cool OCCUPATION to have though.",
  "let me see...",
  "that is pretty crazy!",
  "i don't know - i will research later.",
  "that ’ s a little expensive.",
  "oh so maybe that why.",
  "more like straight out of weird!",
  "why are you interested in working with this BUSINESS?",
  "yeah i am not sure.",
  "can we talk about it now?",
  "they must have had a PRODUCT to help them.",
  "i appreciate you frankness.",
  "i wonder why just now.",
  "yeah that was pretty funny.",
  "the thanksgiving sandwich!",
  "apparently.",
  "how do you like working in BUSINESS?",
  "not really but it is pretty heartbreaking.",
  "that's crazy too.",
  "can you tell me how long your PRODUCT has been messing up?",
  "well, i don't know.",
  "it's seriously good.",
  "and after the PRODUCT?",
  "but how's the sound PRODUCT?",
  "does it taste good?",
  "i didnt hear about that.",
  "LOCATION of it.",
  "i had heard he trained in the ORG.",
  "mmm. sounds about right.",
  "i do very much.",
  "i read about that!",
  "lucky you!",
  "yeah it's crazy that they bought them.",
  "i dont know what that is.",
  "it's free, but the monthly PRODUCT is $ 24.",
  "how much do you mean then?",
  "it seems like it's been so since long before 2000.",
  "here ’ s the PRODUCT ; you can read them yourself.",
  "she's eighty-seven.",
  "oh, let me guess.",
  "i doubt it, i ‘ ll deal with it right away.",
  "OCCUPATION pedro.",
  "that's quite cool.",
  "yeah they only wore black on special EVENT.",
  "that's good!",
  "ya i hope so!",
  "it's ok.thank you.",
  "he's prejudiced, isn't he?",
  "i wonder if that is accurate.",
  "it was supposed to be for $ 100.",
  "i dont why.",
  "you know you would spend it.",
  "i wonder how old he was.",
  "i would think they are running smoothly.",
  "always... ORG has never said no to anything.",
  "aunt rose!",
  "you should've just asked me.",
  "i would not want to live anywhere that far LOCATION.",
  "so what would that mean?",
  "that's very impressive!",
  "a PRODUCT and more.",
  "be warned, sir.",
  "yeah i think that's ridiculous!",
  "it is amazing how some WORK_OF_ART like that just click with everyone.",
  "speaking of qb.",
  "the first LOCATION.",
  "i hadn't heard that!",
  "what are they doing there?",
  "right same here (if i did work in that LOCATION).",
  "he totally looks like PERSON!",
  "yeah i think older PRODUCT are so cool.",
  "over there.",
  "probably so true.",
  "i only know of PERSON.",
  "i will look up BUSINESS.",
  "same you you!",
  "i just use my wife's PRODUCT.",
  "do you know how to do it?",
  "sure, i'll let you know if i need anything.",
  "it ’ s rash.",
  "i wonder how it sounded.",
  "then one to LOCATION at 10 thirty.",
  "well if not.",
  "wow that's amazing!!",
  "that's very awesome.",
  "thank you very much",
  "i think i would too!",
  "i will do that soon.",
  "exactly what i was gonna say.",
  "i'm pretty sure that it has.",
  "i liked him when he played.",
  "well, suffer then.",
  "no, i'm afraid that's it.",
  "that it does.",
  "that ’ ll do.",
  "it will be fun.",
  "do you study ACADEMIC_DISCIPLINE at all?",
  "i know, don ’ t remind me.",
  "really strange.",
  "PRODUCT were definitely important back then.",
  "i don't know what to suggest.",
  "that is completely insane.",
  "yeah, that's fine.",
  "it was great talking to you.",
  "i used to watch them regularly.",
  "i wonder who fell for that.",
  "both sound exhausting.",
  "are you interested in ACADEMIC_DISCIPLINE?",
  "yeah, you are right, but it's really interesting.",
  "i probably have.",
  "i guess i like some.",
  "i am sure it is but they could not have patented it.",
  "i don't like those either.",
  "yes, i'm glad i have come.",
  "not sure ..",
  "and here's her WORK_OF_ART!",
  "it does, actually.",
  "i watch it.",
  "here is an PRODUCT.",
  "probably just wants to be in LOCATION.",
  "they must be kicking themselves.",
  "sounds nice for the ORG?",
  "i always just click PRODUCT and hope for the best.",
  "i guess you could go there.",
  "i'm sure it just means you can't mistreat them.",
  "well, imagine that!",
  "also amazing.",
  "very possible.",
  "i was at BUSINESS before.",
  "i wish i did still have them.",
  "that is why they are phasing out PRODUCT.",
  "dc is very expensive to raise ORG.",
  "who are you supporting for OCCUPATION in 2020?",
  "just made it to the wrong LOCATION.",
  "they ' ve just renovated the FAC.",
  "yes...i do!",
  "i heard that once.",
  "yeah i heard about that two.",
  "i do not listen much now.",
  "if i were you, i'd buy.",
  "i do not actually.",
  "with the right PRODUCT.",
  "i guess because we do not speak it.",
  "she probably contaminated it for every else.",
  "im not surprised.",
  "that's so weird.",
  "i wonder if they are also common to use to protect you PRODUCT!",
  "they're neat.",
  "that is surprising and i was honestly unaware of that.",
  "that ’ s true.",
  "i'm curious to know as well.",
  "it was a good one.",
  "sounds like a nice NORP.",
  "maybe i'll try it.",
  "while you are at it.",
  "have you already forgotten?",
  "yeah better to keep them as they are i guess.",
  "that would not be good!",
  "in 1936.",
  "do you like reading?",
  "president banana right?",
  "yeah i think that is pretty cool.",
  "maybe someday.",
  "i do listen to the PRODUCT.",
  "i think i had heard that too.",
  "yeah, i know, but what about the FOOD?",
  "i think not.",
  "that ’ s not all!",
  "not really...  why ?",
  "that surprises me since he was very presidential.",
  "i did not see that one.",
  "our FOOD is fresh.",
  "i think that's funny too.",
  "yes i just found out they were ORG.",
  "yes, they can.",
  "that's amusing.",
  "ya that sounds pretty cool actually.",
  "it's honestly scary to think about.",
  "yep i do also!",
  "i didn't know it dated that far back.",
  "that is wild and yes i would love to read those!",
  "i guess they could use something else.",
  "actually there is a new PRODUCT coming.",
  "actually, i ’ m thirty now.",
  "i should have?",
  "i tune in regularly.",
  "yeah apparently they have.",
  "i have too bad",
  "it was discovered by ORG in 2013 but i don't know what they call it exactly",
  "yeah i would think that they would.",
  "i trust you.",
  "i bet they are so rich they don't need to sell it.",
  "but even that.",
  "it would seem he is.",
  "oh yeah i grew up watching them.",
  "my front PRODUCT was busted.",
  "i would be so confused if someone said that.",
  "im nor sure.",
  "when the ORG is involved.",
  "it is going to be held by LOCATION in 2022",
  "i mean isn't it now worth 2 billion?",
  "ORG -",
  "when will you reach there?",
  "i love them too.",
  "i never have seen it.",
  "yeah they were smart.",
  "no i never heard of it.",
  "i may have to google the early PRODUCT.",
  "yes i'm going with some of my ORG actually.",
  "you have to be realistic.",
  "no i have.",
  "not only is it affordable, but it comes with all the PRODUCT.",
  "what that's crazy to learn.",
  "that does seem just crazy.",
  "but it's already awfully close.",
  "they amaze me.",
  "no more, thank you very much.",
  "are they expensive?",
  "so what have you been up to?",
  "yeah i always wondered how he did that.",
  "i wouldn ’ t do that if i were you.",
  "i am sorry to hear.",
  "what is that a sequal or something.",
  "i am going to go look into planning a EVENT there.",
  "i enjoy traveling.",
  "he is?",
  "my ORG did.",
  "that's what i was just wondering.",
  "considering their PRODUCT maybe 100 lb?",
  "it's kind of sad because PRODUCT has been around for so long.",
  "i am sorry, it's out of BUSINESS right now.",
  "do you have a ANIMAL ?",
  "do i?",
  "i enjoy watching it sometimes.",
  "well, good for you.",
  "that is so sad.",
  "that would not surprise me at all.",
  "it is interesting and i know right.",
  "i havent been to LOCATION.",
  "yes, it does seem a little silly to cash it now.",
  "she sure does.",
  "couldn't have done worse.",
  "it used to be but it no longer is.",
  "she was very educated.",
  "i have read your PRODUCT.",
  "i think she is.",
  "we still have most of the PRODUCT we bought.",
  "no but i hear that if two of them get stuck together.",
  "i have to admit it's easier said than done.",
  "and what else could be done with $200 million?",
  "yeah that is awesome to know.",
  "especially if someone famous has used them.",
  "i also like it when he sings.",
  "i wonder if the WORK_OF_ART works.",
  "i'll have that too.",
  "i would prefer next thursday.",
  "hopefully not too much.",
  "what are they currently?",
  "i am sure some of those are really good!",
  "they are worth $2b so they must be doing something right!",
  "it's so true.",
  "do you want to go to the LOCATION there?",
  "ah interesting.",
  "i bet it was really minimalist and expensive!",
  "sure, they can eat some FOOD.",
  "oh, it's highly efficient.",
  "you're not kidding there!",
  "the solar PRODUCT are funny.",
  "yeah i am not too sure",
  "i love to play.",
  "that i'm not sure of as i don't watch many.",
  "i loved the BUSINESS.",
  "alright, let's go.",
  "i know and it sucks that PRODUCT did that.",
  "nope i heard about that.",
  "yeah that would be nice.",
  "yeah i think i read that he isn't in the top 3.",
  "i wonder why they are surprised by that?",
  "and i thought changing a PRODUCT was tough...",
  "yeah i guess you do not need one after all.",
  "it was pretty good.",
  "they haven't yet as far as i know.",
  "what ?",
  "really????",
  "oh so thats him.",
  "yeah i think they were trying to protect him.",
  "it keeps you from getting sued if you perform badly.",
  "that does seem wrong!",
  "and apparently he is not even mentioned in it",
  "would you like another bigger one?",
  "it must be pretty big then?",
  "yes, we'll do so.",
  "yes, you play the PRODUCT well.",
  "he also founded BUSINESS.",
  "did you buy new PRODUCT too?",
  "imagine if they did that still?",
  "they are annoying right!",
  "that seems a little strange to do.",
  "i think otherwise.",
  "yeah do you know when the PRODUCT first came out?",
  "i've been when i was younger.",
  "can't imagine why he got the ORG involved.",
  "yes PRODUCT is amazing.",
  "it says he was a very strict NORP.",
  "i have and can they also participate in the PRODUCT?",
  "it does seem dumb but i guess i can respect that.",
  "do you watch the BUSINESS?",
  "driving with a wooden PRODUCT must of been unsafe.",
  "you were really lucky.",
  "that's kind of interesting though.",
  "OCCUPATION as green lantern?",
  "i agree with you about that!",
  "that's so interesting.",
  "wow that's loud!",
  "i used to but not as much anymore",
  "so many!",
  "yeah it is just a PRODUCT for them but it seems to work",
  "i don't remember which one.",
  "yeah they weigh like 1.100 PRODUCT!!!",
  "did you know that cost more than 300$ to travel across LOCATION?",
  "yes it was 222-0 and do you know who was playing?",
  "that must have been awesome.",
  "i recently found out about this.",
  "it was for 4",
  "yeah i would totally agree there.",
  "oh, no!",
  "yeah that is strange indeed.",
  "i would greatly appreciate that.",
  "i am surprised that it's even that many.",
  "do you think you can tell me where it is?",
  "i feel bad for those that work in their BUSINESS.",
  "would you mind relocating?",
  "yeah it is actually just a LANGUAGE and nothing more.",
  "i wonder how comfortable the PRODUCT are.",
  "i bet he could dunk easily!",
  "maybe you should.",
  "you know who didn't have hollow PRODUCT.",
  "pretty well.",
  "not too many actually.",
  "that is right.",
  "i never knew she was ever ranked that low",
  "lebron james!",
  "it was in LOCATION.",
  "disagreeing... sure!",
  "now you're talking.",
  "it is very kind of you.",
  "where had you heard about that?",
  "yup!",
  "what do you think about PRODUCT.",
  "sure, i'll just go and get it now.",
  "i guess i can do that.",
  "i never was either.",
  "i'd say that's a very talented ORG.",
  "i guess that's true.",
  "oh, you went to the EVENT?",
  "like 180 of them.",
  "now may i check this WORK_OF_ART out?",
  "it was worth $104 billion in 2012!",
  "same with me.",
  "i like collecting WORK_OF_ART.",
  "he may be injured.",
  "yeah that would be incredible.",
  "can you tell me how it is done?",
  "did you see",
  "yeah, so, are you going to buy one?",
  "yes he was a staunch NORP and therefore that was not allowed",
  "yes he is very intelligent.",
  "but no dressing up like WORK_OF_ART, right?",
  "i am amazed.",
  "that's very upsetting.",
  "maybe they should hire PERSON.",
  "okay, i'll be right back...",
  "that seems crazy!",
  "not sure i have NORP in any.",
  "yes, it's all right.",
  "LAW.",
  "$25 million",
  "i did and i really loved it.",
  "that does sound kind of different!",
  "i won ’ t go any lower than $ 1050.",
  "i don't think i would listen to that.",
  "i think that would be ok.who will be driving it?",
  "yes, i could.",
  "i thought so too!",
  "that would be cool to visit.",
  "i already bought the FAC twice.",
  "ok, that'd be very nice.",
  "oh, that would be lovely.",
  "he must have been.",
  "i am not impressed with him at all.",
  "on another WORK_OF_ART.",
  "i doubt it ever will.",
  "yeah he donated his own WORK_OF_ART which totaled 32 000.",
  "yes especially when if you're not one of the ORG.",
  "is it made of FOOD?",
  "yeah i am confused too.",
  "i am not aware of that.",
  "we always sell the best.",
  "it all depends.",
  "i saw PERSON once.",
  "i think i can find it.",
  "i'm pretty sure it is more than double that now.",
  "yeah they are just really nice WORK_OF_ART.",
  "it would be funny to see that happen nowadays.",
  "thats astonishing.",
  "but, sir, i didn't drink at all.",
  "it was a male ORG.",
  "eighteen.",
  "no, we didn't go there.",
  "thank you too.",
  "i don't know but BUSINESS will probably adapt.",
  "i didn't think about that but you are right.",
  "he was on the SPORT_TEAM.",
  "that is just not fair.",
  "if you indeed don't know how to answer, admit it frankly.",
  "oh so it is him!",
  "no, i think it's enough.",
  "i haven't seen him lately.",
  "well, i just wanted to say well done.",
  "wow. is that even really possible?",
  "no i didn't.",
  "i have only had one PRODUCT before.",
  "really they did a EVENT?",
  "if it means that all the LOCATION are well maintained then i'm all for it.",
  "maybe i'll be the one.",
  "we'll send a squad PRODUCT shortly.",
  "are you going to leave?",
  "i wonder if that's what made PRODUCT take off so much.",
  "i heard that!!",
  "i wonder if that is healthy though.",
  "i bet he has.",
  "do you honestly think we can compete though?",
  "i try to play the PRODUCT.",
  "well it sounds better than listening to PERSON.",
  "well. as cool as that is.",
  "or make the like PRODUCT illegal.",
  "you like it, huh?",
  "his PRODUCT.",
  "it should be really easy.",
  "oh yes",
  "that is pretty wild.",
  "i don't know how.",
  "not as far as i know..",
  "i would like to try that.",
  "how dare you say that?",
  "that is amazing and very determined.",
  "that seems very controlling.",
  "probably why they had to arrest that one back in the 80's.",
  "it works if you keep at it.",
  "that is so comforting to hear.",
  "yes and it is quite a big FAC so you won't miss it.",
  "what happened to that LAW.",
  "i agree i think that is unfair as well.",
  "prior to 1963.",
  "well that is silly.",
  "i think he is.",
  "there are some really serious ORG that's for sure.",
  "PRODUCT are amazing.",
  "i just skim them.",
  "certainly not playing in 6.",
  "i did that already, while i was waiting.",
  "i just checked it out.",
  "it's super popular too.",
  "the PRODUCT is just too dynamic.",
  "i also enjoyed PERSON in it.",
  "yeah that is really clever.",
  "yes, what can i do for you?",
  "hey.",
  "no i agree with that.",
  "how would they test that?",
  "yeah he was the OCCUPATION after all.",
  "all you have to do is cook some white FOOD.",
  "i guess it could happen.",
  "right. same with the ORG.",
  "who do you think will make it to SPORTS_EVENT if you had to guess?",
  "so only it make to fly very high and far away.",
  "really so he sold it twice?",
  "yeah it is pretty good to have them nearby.",
  "i watch as much as i can.",
  "i wonder why they did that and yes.",
  "did you hear how he tore his PRODUCT?",
  "$123.000!!",
  "u2  thank you",
  "creed?",
  "i guess the LOCATION is new.",
  "let ’ s think realistically about what might happen.",
  "uh, are you sure about that?",
  "no i never noticed that either.",
  "ORG keeps trying.",
  "i will be voting.",
  "i have never taken out a PRODUCT.",
  "that sounds perfect for us.",
  "we have some of the wealthiest OCCUPATION though.",
  "i wonder why the did that.",
  "havent heard about her.",
  "i bet you're right on that.",
  "i think that would be awesome.",
  "likely!",
  "i only knew two!",
  "i believe she is done with the WORK_OF_ART.",
  "yes, it wasn't too hard to get.",
  "why do you buy BUSINESS, then?",
  "wow i have to google that like right now.",
  "oh i bet you are right!",
  "they are very good.",
  "there is really so much that most of us never hear about or learn about.",
  "yeah maybe like NORP.",
  "may have cost you.",
  "that's quite something.",
  "i wonder why it's bigger?",
  "we do.",
  "yes those are no better at just 44%.",
  "yes and i wonder what prompted them to do that",
  "no i was not aware of that.",
  "would you like FOOD with that?",
  "that's nice, but tell me what she looks like.",
  "it seems like you like MUSIC_GENRE.",
  "i would have loved that too.",
  "simply because it's not practical at all.",
  "well, it is very beautiful.",
  "i have as well.",
  "it was so good!",
  "it seems like all they do is play TYPE_OF_SPORT.",
  "furnished.",
  "how much could one be sold for?",
  "ya he is awesome.",
  "ha nope not at all.",
  "i think i did see it and it was very entertaining.",
  "i'll try my best.",
  "you could try.",
  "shall we go back home now?",
  "i havent saw that one.",
  "i knew, but i couldn't control myself.",
  "i had heard that but they are super rich already.",
  "no i didn't hear that.",
  "haha imagine?",
  "that  is true.",
  "interesting...i guess so.",
  "yes it is like that.",
  "well, nobody's perfect!",
  "well, you're working very hard but not efficiently.",
  "i ’ d expected it to be much more exciting.",
  "no, can i exchange it for a bigger one?",
  "yeah but they were huge :) and expensive...",
  "yes, i ’ m aware of that.",
  "i hear that.",
  "i don't know either",
  "about 6.",
  "i will definetely watch that one.",
  "you don't think so eh?",
  "well you said that you listen to MUSIC_GENRE.",
  "then you must go to the FAC.",
  "i do not think so but there is no LAW against them if they qualify",
  "thats interesting",
  "i would stick with the ps.",
  "that was hard to believe.",
  "this is worth trying.",
  "that is smart and look how far it has come!",
  "i also have a PRODUCT to be dry-cleaned.",
  "i wonder how that happened?",
  "i'm going to have to look that up.",
  "right that was sad.",
  "i think it is boring too but i love it.",
  "ah very interesting.",
  "i do not although he was caught stealing and lost the SPORTS_SEASON.",
  "yes they were :) young and successful !",
  "i don't think anyone does outside of the NORP.",
  "we don ’",
  "i don't really play much now.",
  "i don't anymore.",
  "how long ago was that.",
  "so, i don ’ t have to pay any of it?",
  "that would be worrisome.",
  "oh fun!",
  "first of all, did you vote EVENT?",
  "$ 50.",
  "ok.come with me, please.",
  "yes i was shocked.",
  "no i wasn't.",
  "he's busy.",
  "so did i!",
  "i ’ m wondering if you like to go to the FAC then.",
  "i guess that explains why PRODUCT is blue then.",
  "definitely FOOD.",
  "can i buy more than one WORK_OF_ART?",
  "wow. must have been really bad.",
  "for a while.",
  "right that is weird.",
  "it is always good to talk.",
  "surely someone did!",
  "i am not sure what she does.",
  "he will certainly try hard.",
  "no i did not",
  "i'm sorry, but we usually don't do it.",
  "i remember when i was younger.",
  "i figured they were the highest paid.",
  "i don't think it's realistic.",
  "how much is this going to cost?",
  "to top it off.",
  "do you like the OCCUPATION.",
  "i love to drink FOOD.",
  "right, she is so excited and simply can ’ t wait.",
  "all the streaming BUSINESS seem to be doing that now.",
  "i can imagine.",
  "i'm a little familiar with her.",
  "i hope this won ’ t be our last EVENT.",
  "that's interesting!",
  "naughty?",
  "let ’ s go together.",
  "how do you want your FOOD, rare, medium or well-done?",
  "not just yet.",
  "he might be good and we are just missing out.",
  "yeah. ironically by PERSON.",
  "they're definitely intelligent!",
  "i heard about LOCATION.",
  "that LOCATION looks nice.",
  "maybe he was just trying to be funny?",
  "i think they're trying to scare the young ORG so that they don't ever start smoking.",
  "linkin park!",
  "i ’ m temping at a pharmaceutical BUSINESS.",
  "i will have to check that one out.",
  "how many OCCUPATION did it win?",
  "oh yes you're totally right.",
  "so, you can read and write much better than you speak and understand other LANGUAGE, right?",
  "yeah he was 25 and that was back in 2012",
  "i would like to know that as well.",
  "i wouldnt mind it.",
  "well, you might pinch your PRODUCT!",
  "i did not",
  "yeah i wonder who it was for though.",
  "have you tried martial TYPE_OF_SPORT ?",
  "i am afraid that is not acceptable.",
  "ORG also have their own called blutube!",
  "pomp & circumstance.",
  "oh i'm sure he would.",
  "about what?",
  "he's the highest paid ever?",
  "i couldn't live somewhere where i couldn't drive around if i wanted to.",
  "it is nasty i agree.",
  "there.",
  "i just ran alongside the main LOCATION.",
  "isn't there anything else?",
  "i think the OCCUPATION who play it should have been fired.",
  "well, we ’ d like to work with you.",
  "i am not sure yet.",
  "i haven't heard it.",
  "that's a prestigious ORG up.",
  "oh thats right.",
  "so much ACADEMIC_DISCIPLINE we dont know.",
  "so are you!",
  "that sounds so romantic!",
  "it ’ s just a little shorter.",
  "it's a PRODUCT.",
  "go get it.",
  "i can live with that.",
  "they have and they do.",
  "no but that makes me hungry!",
  "that sounds fun!",
  "well that's really good for him!",
  "that tells you something ...",
  "are you sure she was trying to put you down?",
  "who?",
  "i checked.",
  "that is just amazing.",
  "wow. could they be more obvious!!",
  "if you're addicted then i'm not sure how much that would help.",
  "ah that is scary.",
  "no, thank you.",
  "that's so expensive just to cross the LOCATION!",
  "they are a really great SPORT_TEAM.",
  "that is so insane.",
  "he was an odd OCCUPATION.",
  "so.",
  "yes as long as they qualify .",
  "the FAC is quite new and well constructed.",
  "yeah i always thought they were expensive.",
  "that ’ s ok.",
  "i believe that from 9 pm to 12am.",
  "there is a PRODUCT where you can listen for free.",
  "speaking of ACADEMIC_DISCIPLINE.",
  "it was the BUSINESS.",
  "ah yes i heard about that.",
  "that makes me sad honestly.",
  "yes, it probably is.",
  "that would be fun to see.",
  "i wish he could too.",
  "yeah he almost quit TYPE_OF_SPORT!",
  "i would assume they do.",
  "now we're talking.",
  "that must be nice!",
  "she did!",
  "$9 for the WORK_OF_ART.",
  "gee.",
  "i am sure they do.",
  "i like to.",
  "they should be ashamed i totally agree with you.",
  "yeah, it can get pretty lonely over the EVENT.",
  "t / t, please.",
  "sounds reasonable.",
  "yeah it would be worth it.",
  "they did now.",
  "i didnt know that no.",
  "it's very silly.",
  "that's actually interesting.",
  "i totally agree there.. who knows what is yet to be discovered",
  "that i thought was very interesting.",
  "apparently very soon.",
  "yep i wish they had that here.",
  "they have to be!",
  "heres a good one.",
  "that's kind of scary to think about.",
  "that sounds pretty fun.",
  "interesting. may have to check that out also.",
  "well, i'm not so sure.",
  "merry christmas to you!",
  "i dont see it happening anytime soon.",
  "i'm unsure.",
  "15 % is impossible.",
  "i have not played that one.",
  "that would be so nice.",
  "i was wondering that too.",
  "that is outrageous.",
  "perhaps not.",
  "yeah pretty creative of him to do that",
  "i can ’ t wait to go there myself.",
  "ya ive heard of him.",
  "they are entertaining to watch.",
  "that is to bad.",
  "yes and shall we go fifty-fifty for the FOOD?",
  "that's me.",
  "are you hungry?",
  "you can count on me.",
  "to me.",
  "this PRODUCT is perfect for barbecuing.",
  "since 1996 it has been.",
  "can you make it any cheaper?",
  "yes, i'm serious.",
  "i didn't know that",
  "no more than three.",
  "ah yes, i remember now.",
  "that's very very strange!",
  "it is truly unfortunate",
  "that i am not sure.",
  "i'm not sure, perhaps around 8 pm.",
  "not many.",
  "the innocence!",
  "there is that.",
  "i haven't been on it in so long.",
  "yep that's cool.",
  "exactly...i dont think so either",
  "yes, you could if it's kept intact.",
  "we'll see.",
  "huh. haven't heard about that one.",
  "i do academic ACADEMIC_DISCIPLINE.",
  "you really didn't have a very traditional EVENT, did you?",
  "i think the big SPORTS_LEAGUE just weren't that big yet.",
  "i am looking for a more challenging OCCUPATION.",
  "& you?",
  "that could happen for sure!",
  "so i was reading.",
  "that is hilarious!!!",
  "that still shocks me.",
  "meanwhile.",
  "yeah and he was so eccentric that he took the PRODUCT and did it himself.",
  ":0.",
  "that's what the PRODUCT said.",
  "it's good to have you in the ORG.",
  "oh you play ?",
  "i've never actually listened to one.",
  "that would be crazy but also interesting.",
  "i have all of that with me.",
  "perhaps he was trying to be funny.",
  "that means nothing to me unfortunately.",
  "really crazy!",
  "i did not know they were that old!",
  "don't you dare tell me that...",
  "when you do travel.",
  "that is amazing i would like to read more about that",
  "yes about 86% of it but most of it is LOCATION anyways",
  "i think i've only seen a few.",
  "do you use BUSINESS?",
  "no that is really funny!",
  "i have a young ORG.",
  "you can buy almost anything and get it shipped on sunday by ORG!",
  "yeah that would be pretty cool.",
  "apparently they exist.",
  "wasn't it for exhausted ORG?",
  "i just got back from LOCATION.",
  "i bet it was funny.",
  "i guess its not for everyone.",
  "is that all?",
  "yeah that could be very weird.",
  "too bad they had to break up.",
  "oh, i don ’ t know where we ’ re going yet.",
  "ah i see i'll have to look at that.",
  "she's kind of short.",
  "PRODUCT on the radio?",
  "i bet she would.",
  "i think i've heard that somewhere...",
  "i didnt know that i love to shop at BUSINESS.",
  "i'm a little envious.",
  "hmm i am not sure actually.",
  "yep i agree with you!",
  "never been one for dressing up myself.",
  "i have watched a few here and there.",
  "i can't believe they surpasses BUSINESS.",
  "i think i will see it.",
  "i would appreciate it.",
  "me either the WORK_OF_ART are too expensive.",
  "yeah. same here.",
  "how is that the only FOOD that you'll eat?",
  "how about its PRODUCT?",
  "i agree he is better then they portrayed sadly.",
  "i am enjoying the qb from the SPORT_TEAM play so well",
  "oh, i wouldn't worry about it.",
  "that is nuts to me.",
  "yeah it is indeed.",
  "that's impressive and probably that or more that are no longer around.",
  "that is very strange.",
  "i don't really read anymore.",
  "she was great.",
  "i was vaguely familiar with h.o.t. .",
  "whoa!",
  "no, but i ’ d like to learn how to use them.",
  "i hear you.",
  "of course.it is really fantastic too, and it makes me eager to dance.",
  "he didn't seem that good when he was playing with SPORT_TEAM.",
  "yes, because i love yours.",
  "right. must be.",
  "i guess you would have to show them on your PRODUCT or something.",
  "that is pretty low.",
  "how much are your WORK_OF_ART worth?",
  "they are still sort of underpaid in my NORP.",
  "i didn't noticed that at all.",
  "i would have thought he would be the highest paid",
  "so, how do i use it?",
  "i like FOOD to eat.",
  "you mean that he's NATION?",
  "we will have to look that up.",
  "i enjoy TYPE_OF_SPORT the most.",
  "oh and oddly enough.",
  "just FOOD will be fine.",
  "i agree 100%.",
  "they are all corrupt.",
  "i feel that he is very intelligent.",
  "ya there might be.",
  "that is funny but also sad.",
  "i will sometime.",
  "no but that's really sad.",
  "it seems to work.",
  "i was somewhat aware of that but i don't really know the different ACADEMIC_DISCIPLINE.",
  "im surprised that it is that high.",
  "wtf?",
  "i forgot to put.",
  "i love him.",
  "along queen's road...",
  "yeah definitely.",
  "yeah he knows what he wants it seems.",
  "i want to fight that PRODUCT.",
  "ok.give me one, please.",
  "something magical about that!",
  "has your PRODUCT turned back on yet?",
  "no, you don ’ t have to.",
  "yes because it was easy to dial on a rotary PRODUCT",
  "i'm not sure how many show up.",
  "that ’ s all right.",
  "is it really legal?",
  "it's 60 PRODUCT, please.",
  "i am not sure what he built it for.",
  "i feel sorry for you.",
  "i'm surprised as well.",
  "it is made of solid PRODUCT.",
  "yes, please.",
  "i was in the ORG as well so i would love to see it.",
  "yeah we can.",
  "i listen to those MUSIC_GENRE every once in a while.",
  "i thought you recognize she from there.",
  "do you think it could be any good ?",
  "yes i suppose they do.",
  "that must be it.",
  "i was not aware of that until you mentioned it.",
  "that is really unfair i hope they ruled against him.",
  "i do sometimes and there is a free PRODUCT where you can listen to them",
  "they have one BUSINESS left.",
  "well, don't bother.",
  "no i don't think we can either.",
  "you know what suprised me?",
  "it is pretty bad.",
  "now i have to google it to figure out what they are.",
  "yeah i still watch some tv.",
  "they can be okay.",
  "i mean you couldn't give it up!",
  "yeah i don't know how long i could listen to something like that.",
  "i do not like her at all.",
  "i do not use it.",
  "that shouldn't be allowed.",
  "i guess if you're short it's barely worth running.",
  "i had heard that somewhere and thought it was so funny.",
  "i think that makes him too qualified for the ORG.",
  "it's not what you're thinking.",
  "it would look silly.",
  "that's kind of funny.",
  "i don ’ t need it anymore.",
  "i don't know it.",
  "i would have loved to learn to play one of those.",
  "when will it be available?",
  "i agree with you there.",
  "he started a PRODUCT that has evolved tremendously.",
  "he definitely seems to be.",
  "i only wanted to help him.",
  "maybe you should think about moving.",
  "yeah, what happened?",
  "everything is ok now.",
  "lucky man!",
  "the SPORTS_EVENT.",
  "okay, i ’ ll take it.",
  "why don't you put it in your FOOD?",
  "haha well he better for his WORK_OF_ART!",
  "i think he is great!",
  "thats really really far away!",
  "not to mention.",
  "i mostly just listen to the PRODUCT.",
  "i was surprised that it was that many.",
  "i know that but it must be according to a NORP.",
  "cheer up!",
  "i imagine it didn't do well.",
  "i wonder if this is right?",
  "after or before 12?",
  "they are in the SPORTS_SEASON.",
  "i'm surprised it's that much.",
  "there must be about 50 PRODUCT in here.",
  "i think that is odd.",
  "i did know that actually.",
  "oh i have not ever heard that.",
  "i heard there are some intellectual WORK_OF_ART in there that are fairly masked.",
  "i liked them both.",
  "it will be ready right away.",
  "maybe they seem more nervous!",
  "im glad that someone is preserving them.",
  "i think it's just impossible.",
  "yeah i always found it weird how they naturally just start dancing to MUSIC_GENRE.",
  "that is correct.",
  "you are smart that is correct.",
  "all right, i see.",
  "ya he seems like it.",
  "that's rough.",
  "i just wondered if anyone would crack them open.",
  "yeah i am excited.",
  "yeah, you are right!",
  "i dont usually use BUSINESS.",
  "i am not picky on FOOD.",
  "it ’ s nice that she ’ s back for a while.",
  "sounds awesome!",
  "that's outrageous!",
  "did this just start happening, or has it been going on for a while?",
  "i've heard of WORK_OF_ART but never saw it.",
  "ya i listen to the PRODUCT sometimes.",
  "well since it is the ORG who knows.",
  "i bet that OCCUPATION got teased for it later.",
  "i wonder how much you burn playing TYPE_OF_SPORT?",
  "yeah i didnt get that.",
  "i went once or twice.",
  "yes, i told him that you were very ill and couldn't attend.",
  "huh i'll look into it.",
  "have you heard of the SPORT_TEAM?",
  "no, should i have?",
  "oh i remember that.",
  "yeah, i think i'll go.",
  "ya for sure.",
  "god!",
  "LOCATION has got to be different.",
  "so we need to find someone taller than him for 2020.",
  "it doesn't say why he did that.",
  "it must be very boring.",
  "i've heard of that.",
  "started out as an online PRODUCT and now they have there hand in everything.",
  "that sounds pretty cool!",
  "where ’ d you meet him?",
  "do you already have an BUSINESS with us?",
  "12 of them wow.",
  "will it be as strong as the original?",
  "i don't care how much it costs.",
  "may i ask why you decided to switch your BUSINESS to us?",
  "how about flymo?",
  "ah that is so cute.",
  "you can throw that away.",
  "that's the same with me.",
  "i have heard about it.",
  "that's sad for who lost them.",
  "most definitely.",
  "that is the SPORT_TEAM.",
  "i'll have a FOOD of the best.",
  "i think they went to LOCATION, but i'm not sure.",
  "i didnt know that .",
  "he has certainly done well for himself.",
  "that was pretty funny.",
  "possibly you are now.",
  "i also hope that.",
  "oh that is funny.",
  "what would we do without them!",
  "it's not special.",
  "she doesn't usually wear PRODUCT.",
  "that seems unprofessional!",
  "oh darn it.",
  "i actually haven't but it sounds exciting.",
  "that may be so.",
  "thats really interesting.",
  "never heard of LOCATION.",
  "i'm not sure",
  "01088256798",
  "are you available this friday?",
  "i don't really listen to the PRODUCT much.",
  "i guess it does.",
  "okay, here you go.",
  "i really enjoy both but i probably lean a little more towards WORK_OF_ART.",
  "it ’ s so nice and quiet in the LOCATION.",
  "there's so much to unpack there.",
  "we do indeed.",
  "i agree with BUSINESS.",
  "i've got something.",
  "have you been to any?",
  "i ’ m going to vote.",
  "are you still mad at her now?",
  "there's also a LOCATION.",
  "that ’ s strange.",
  "it was silly.",
  "i think i will start off in LOCATION.",
  "i do think i have heard something about it before.",
  "it must have been a WORK_OF_ART.",
  "i haven't no. have you?",
  "that is crazy to think!",
  "i wouldn't like that at all.",
  "i wonder if they ever sleep ever.",
  "probably pretty gamey.",
  "yeah its only available in am PRODUCT i think.",
  "not very big.",
  "can i have a black PRODUCT over there?",
  "i never knew how popular it was.",
  "it is wasteful i agree.",
  "where did you get it from?",
  "i heard that a little while ago and couldn't believe it.",
  "i do like PRODUCT.",
  "that sounds ridiculous.",
  "did you ever see him live ?",
  "not my favorite.",
  "i didn't know that they could.",
  "i ’ ll drink to that!",
  "that is so short.",
  "do you watch the",
  "that is what i heard.",
  "i believe it will be difficult to unhook NATION from using them though",
  "but he is always talking big.",
  "and ya.",
  "i do not know who that is.",
  "it paid off!",
  "i could talk for that long.",
  "all set.",
  "why doesn't he meet us outside?",
  "do you know where it is or how big the LOCATION is?",
  "isn't that crazy something so small can power something so big?",
  "he does not.",
  "well that is fascinating.",
  "i dont think that either.",
  "i don't think nobody does.",
  "i can tell you where i got mine.",
  "this WORK_OF_ART though had to be impressive.",
  "yeah but there are also great ORG.",
  "i will thank you.",
  "green FOOD are too sour for me.",
  "well, i don't find her attractive, but i'm sure you will disagree.",
  "yes i think it will and already has.",
  "i think he would make a good WORK_OF_ART.",
  "if it worked.",
  "i get it pretty bad.",
  "i wonder what they sound like.",
  "were you in or out?",
  "that is really cool you went to LOCATION.",
  "i know.he made up the LAW.",
  "i like those two as well.",
  "i figured.",
  "yes, both.",
  "he ’ s going to be sent to LOCATION to study, really?",
  "it ’ s very good.",
  "he's always had it in him.",
  "i havent heard it.",
  "how much did it cost you?",
  "i heard about him never got to watch him play.",
  "all right, i'll have it registered, then.",
  "i ’ ve prepared most of it already",
  "PRODUCT?",
  "wow i agree with them.",
  "i'm not sure..",
  "great, then we can add everything up and take it to the BUSINESS.",
  "oh i never knew that interesting.",
  "i am pretty much open to listening to most NORP.",
  "here is the 6,100 PRODUCT.",
  "both actually.",
  "i've never heard of them before.",
  "maybe we should call him OCCUPATION.",
  "i did not know either.",
  "weird!",
  "did you go to LOCATION here?",
  "i wondered the same!",
  "that would be neat if we had something like that here.",
  "love that one!",
  "you need to fix it.",
  "it is so expensive.",
  "it can be useful.",
  "how much do they weigh?",
  "but it's true.",
  "i didn't know he did that.",
  "yeah i think so.",
  "wow that was nice of them.",
  "but really, maybe this can work.",
  "mmm... does it zip closed?",
  "i will do.",
  "as long as it isn't too far from this LOCATION, i don't mind.",
  "do you speak LANGUAGE?",
  "that is pretty funny as well.",
  "i didn't know it was that many",
  "i'm going to.",
  "also weren't NATIONAL undefeated in 2010?",
  "that is so immature.",
  "well, i ’ m really glad we bumped into each other.",
  "that is also very crazy.",
  "i watch TYPE_OF_SPORT every sunday.",
  "that is actually very recent.",
  "okay, i'll do that later.",
  "all those who spoke.",
  "it means they are able to move.",
  "so did i was amazed that they can play if called on.",
  "i don't play.",
  "he really could.",
  "probably so.",
  "oh, can i?",
  "do i need to buy anything else?",
  "same here.....",
  "it is actually white.",
  "mm — PRODUCT.",
  "why not start with the most interesting one?",
  "that is genrous of them.",
  "that will be best.",
  "it really isn ’ t.",
  "ok, it's open.",
  "is it in the other LOCATION?",
  "i didn't know they could.",
  "yea !",
  "where are they hidden?",
  "ok.but i'm not familiar.",
  "no thats funny.",
  "it does not change anything.",
  "it doesn't really say.",
  "maybe they are aggressively searching.",
  "and they bought whole FOOD.",
  "me too they are super handy nowadays.",
  "i think he will as well.",
  "i know we all loved it so much.",
  "yes, yes, he's right here by me.",
  "no i didnt hear about that EVENT.",
  "that is unfair!",
  "love stories?",
  "when was that ?",
  "it is TYPE_OF_SPORT!",
  "yeah but once they won back to back CHAMPIONSHIP and then no more",
  "oh, i see how this FOOD can be really hard for you.",
  "are the PRODUCT all right?",
  "i watch it occasionally.",
  "he does thats new to me.",
  "i bet we will.",
  "i use BUSINESS for that.",
  "this PRODUCT is only $ 29.95.",
  "yes, i'm dating someone.",
  "no, nothing in particular.",
  "yeah i would feel terrible too.",
  "it is cool.",
  "i'm happy to hear that.",
  "BUSINESS is pretty successful.",
  "he must have been good.",
  "i was just thinking that i hope we can reforest it again.",
  "i bet he didn't get close to $1billion.",
  "i didn't realize MUSIC_GENRE was so global.",
  "i have never done it .",
  "can i take it with FOOD?",
  "some WORK_OF_ART are really old.",
  "no i can't imagine being interested in something that unnecessary.",
  "the london weekly right?",
  "it is unfair it makes me real angry.",
  "oh, i'm not sure.",
  "which SPORT_TEAM do you think will win?",
  "yeah it just makes you think of how small we are",
  "yeah pretty much which is great because they dont need to store it anywhere PRODUCT",
  "yeah they may have ran it right into the LOCATION.",
  "so nice speaking with you.",
  "i haven't lately.",
  "it is really a hot FOOD.",
  "ya have you ever listened to that?",
  "i was just hoping.",
  "do you like PERSON?",
  "well deserved.",
  "it's also convenient, but it's usually crowded.",
  "i think it ’ s 26th september.",
  "he is a weird WORK_OF_ART",
  "mostly BUSINESS.",
  "i know thats amazing.",
  "yes, maybe you can come on friday.",
  "no. don't think so.",
  "he was.",
  "oh goodness!",
  "they are everywhere really.",
  "oh.ACADEMIC_DISCIPLINE.",
  "do you have any ORG here?",
  "i  know right.",
  "no, i am single.",
  "i think you missed out on that one.",
  "didn't he invent TYPE_OF_SPORT too?",
  "yeah that all sounds very weird to me.",
  "yeah, it will become a wider NORP.",
  "that must have been funny!",
  "i did watch it.",
  "i would love to hear that too.",
  "i would imagine at least a few hundred WORK_OF_ART.",
  "i think i've read about that before and have seen the WORK_OF_ART.",
  "i have and i can prove that is 100 % true for you.",
  "you've got everyone figured out, don't you?",
  "thats what it is about.",
  "yes, it ’ s reasonably fast",
  "they're the best.",
  "that sounds good to me.",
  "not for a while.",
  "it is amazing out here.",
  "i wonder if they met how that would go from there",
  "i would imagine that it is.",
  "it has to have been awhile.",
  "ah ya i did.",
  "i never heard about that.",
  "i wonder if that was before or after the PRODUCT.",
  "yep those PRODUCT were great!",
  "it is amazing isn't it.",
  "i hope they get paid extra for that.",
  "i didn't know that and i've never heard of it either.",
  "he is really smart.",
  "i did know this.",
  "i think i remember hearing that somewhere.",
  "yes that was PERSON and he was deaf.",
  "maybe they shorted the BUSINESS.",
  "i do the same.",
  "i'm not sure if they are working together or  competing.",
  "i am not sure but i would love to hear it!",
  "hmm i wonder if it is because they can kid of be safer to store PRODUCT",
  "where would you like to be located?",
  "you should have kept trying.",
  "sometimes!",
  "i'll be glad to do it.",
  "i do enjoy MUSIC_GENRE.",
  "be careful of the PRODUCT.",
  "you're not weak... you're stressed out!",
  "pong!",
  "ok.i'm dick.",
  "is there anything else, sir?",
  "second only to PRODUCT.",
  "i would sell it all and diversify.",
  "maybe by then it will be too late.",
  "do you have a PRODUCT down there?",
  "enough!",
  "i totally agree.",
  "that is the FAC.",
  "yes, there are.",
  "let's watch it together.",
  "i would like to experience LOCATION.",
  "oh i like that PRODUCT.",
  "and what happened ?",
  "i wonder why his OCCUPATION lied about this.",
  "i know he is.",
  "i have seen and heard of PERSON before.",
  "wow. never saw that one!",
  "all that running through the frozen LOCATION would have freaked me out.",
  "you ought to.",
  "what what PRODUCT do they offer?",
  "yeah and they went as far as not to mention him in it",
  "because...",
  "it's really of nothing.",
  "that must have been really bad.",
  "well that sounds nicer.",
  "seems like so much longer.",
  "just like in the LOCATION!",
  "why would someone want that?",
  "probably just because they could",
  "i do like to watch tv.",
  "i think its as important.",
  "i usually read or entertain myself.",
  "and would you like FOOD?",
  "i graduated with LAW.",
  "only one really?",
  "that's probably because he grades on a LOCATION.",
  "i think there is one.",
  "i have never seen that so maybe i am missing out.",
  "yeah and that is just amazing.",
  "it never ends... and i will get worse.",
  "im not really sure.",
  "i wouldn't know.",
  "yes i have and it is recommended by the ORG as well",
  "then does it go well with my PRODUCT?",
  "what do you do there... hang around, like the ORG?",
  "just trim FOOD for cooking.",
  "yeah i was surprised too.",
  "maybe they should be required to speak a foreign LANGUAGE.",
  "you do?",
  "i've never had a cadillac.",
  "i couldn't do it myself",
  "it's hard for me to believe that there is nothing or nobody out there.",
  "yes, a PRODUCT will be fine.",
  "well have you ever been to LOCATION?",
  "i bet he does.",
  "he's an interesting OCCUPATION.",
  "for real!",
  "yeah, i have a little one myself.",
  "that is very innovative!",
  "i like all three of them lol.",
  "maybe. might have to do with the ACADEMIC_DISCIPLINE there.",
  "fantastic actor!",
  "neither do i.  did you know that PERSON.",
  "that was so strange.",
  "don't tell me anything about it.",
  "did they actually get through?",
  "you can't go wrong with BUSINESS.",
  "well at least we are not LOCATION.",
  "i do not remember that.",
  "what should i drink then?",
  "that's pretty neat they are smart enough to get around like that.",
  "isn't that wild.",
  "ok.why don't you just hold the ladder, and i'll put it up.",
  "well... do you forget how it was when you were like 8 ?",
  "that may have changed.",
  "yeah and he was not even mentioned.",
  "i think you are right-",
  "personally.",
  "i dont",
  "i used to when i was younger.",
  "no i haven't have about it.",
  "no. lets talk about the OCCUPATION next.",
  "i think you have to know somebody.",
  "yeah that's pretty funny.",
  "he never was the actual OCCUPATION...",
  "she's beautiful.",
  "will you apologize to her?",
  "i've never heard it.",
  "fine, just fine.",
  "i am not sure of that.",
  "i bet PERSON's not too happy with them.",
  "i think it's really odd.",
  "i enjoy it too.",
  "i know how it works.",
  "yeah...  i guess thats why he built a PRODUCT that should run for 10.000 years.",
  "indeed they do.",
  "yes that seems annoying.",
  "i would say anybody the OCCUPATION invites to stay there.",
  "i was, but then i discovered you can find out everything for free on the PRODUCT,",
  "it is???",
  "yeah and we rely on PRODUCT i think even when we don't realize.",
  "i would have been if the ORG didn't screw it up already ha ha.",
  "did the ORG find who did it?",
  "but we made it.",
  "the lawn goats!",
  "well the PRODUCT is great and we essentially cannot live without it.",
  "no, why?",
  "it is shocking isn't it?",
  "i agree with you they were started back in 1994.",
  "we can get started as soon as you fill out this PRODUCT.",
  "this is unfair.",
  "i would be so nervous.",
  "yeah and it was supposed to star PERSON.",
  "i think its a good one.",
  "sounds like one to me!",
  "that was great!",
  "where are you from where you would have seen these?",
  "i'm sure he's made more since.",
  "PRODUCT tape!",
  "i think she just likes to make us miserable.",
  "didn't she win OCCUPATION for that?",
  "well, sounds promising.",
  "i couldn't even imagine.",
  "i would prefer the first one.",
  "it's getting more complicated.",
  "that is shocking!",
  "but you ’ re crazy about him.",
  "i dont think so either",
  "i guess i haven't seen that many.",
  "i do not know .",
  "i havent seen it yet.",
  "i dont really follow them.",
  "WORK_OF_ART was good.",
  "oh, you mean FAC?",
  "that suits me fine.",
  "no FOOD.",
  "how could i get there?",
  "ORG can barely keep it together as it is!",
  "i wonder if that means something else too in their LANGUAGE",
  "i wonder why they'd do that.",
  "no, no.... it's very hard to get lost.",
  "oh they totally did.",
  "how interesting is that?",
  "how is that unfortunate?",
  "i would of coached differently.",
  "don ’ t, don ’ t, don ’ t, don ’ t say that.",
  "true although i bet they would be very effective like you suggested.",
  "yes, we just got it and it is fabulous.",
  "yes i do own a PRODUCT!",
  "yes i agree with you 100%.",
  "the granny shot!",
  "ok, they begin to register.",
  "can you imagine what that would be like?",
  "i probably have too!!",
  "he was the main WORK_OF_ART.",
  "that would be overkill.",
  "use this PRODUCT.",
  "ha me too.",
  "likewise :)",
  "they don't even exist anymore and BUSINESS worth 2 billion",
  "well i hope someone caught it before someone killed it.",
  "he came in alone.",
  "just a sec i ’ m just gonna vacuum this PRODUCT real fast",
  "no but i'm not surprised.",
  "well hopefully it does not get worse and we plant more PRODUCT quickly to replace some of what we have lost.",
  "seems like he's really talented...",
  "maybe good.",
  "ya i would definitely go to that.",
  "not really that much.",
  "the POLITICAL_PARTY have been around for a while.",
  "i'm getting pretty bored.",
  "no i didnt know that.",
  "you're right.",
  "i think that's something we can all get behind.",
  "so, how did you become interested in it?",
  "it was a good PRODUCT, but not good enough to watch again.",
  "there are other ORG.",
  "my PRODUCT.",
  "he sure did.",
  "no he doesn't.",
  "oh yes i definitely think that's how they measured it!",
  "it depends on the LOCATION.",
  "wow that is pretty cool i guess.",
  "i believe he has won 3.",
  "danny boy yeah.",
  "it does seem weird.",
  "yeah i do not get it",
  "i cannot say that i have.",
  "okay, i ’ ve decided.",
  "this is a useful PRODUCT.",
  "you would be surprised how often that need arises!",
  "yes i like ORG very much as well.",
  "if so we dont hear about it.",
  "i have m6 blue PRODUCT.",
  "i would happily eat.",
  "wow, i can't thank you enough.",
  "that seems really nice!",
  "i never read that one.",
  "it's an old NORP.",
  "ok, i'll get one for you.",
  "or another uk pm.",
  "my hard PRODUCT crashed.",
  "that is exciting.",
  "it is frustrating.",
  "it was written by PERSON.",
  "i am disgusted too.",
  "that is horrible.",
  "did not know that but that is smart for sure.",
  "it does sound better i agree.",
  "that is pretty awesome they came in third.",
  "speaking of the BUSINESS.",
  "i think i may have seen it.",
  "now that is neat!",
  "yeah, i will be there.",
  "may i ask why you're returning the PRODUCT?",
  "did you like PRODUCT?",
  "do you have an WORK_OF_ART you want to send them?",
  "oh wow that is terrible.",
  "yeah they can be potent for sure.",
  "is there anything valuable in it?",
  "sounds pleasant.",
  "seriously!",
  "it started this whole PRODUCT.",
  "sounds about right.",
  "you are not alone there.",
  "i think i heard he was too.",
  "i am not sure if ANIMAL are colorblind?",
  "oh i know they only wear black for special EVENT!",
  "i bet not.",
  "it is beautiful.",
  "someone told me that recently.",
  "and was very admired.",
  "i am not sure who won the most recent CHAMPIONSHIP.",
  "i don't understand what you mean.",
  "yeah it was good too.",
  "yep i would too.",
  "it seems to be working pretty well for them since that has been going on since 1997",
  "maybe make-up would be enough?",
  "he is very good.",
  "i know i have lived in some of those LOCATION.",
  "that seem hard to believe.",
  "as long as you're doing it right",
  "that would have been fun to watch.",
  "yes i read that.",
  "ok, i'll be waiting.",
  "i guess i could never be OCCUPATION.",
  "not sure of that.",
  "and how much did it cost to rent it?",
  "i would actually love to see that.",
  "oh im sorry.",
  "that's a mouthful.",
  "how interesting is that!",
  "i suppose it is at that!",
  "that's silly.",
  "someone once told me if you did not buy a PRODUCT.",
  "i honestly love it.",
  "i just went to look it up.",
  "i never chatted online before.",
  "a little expensive.",
  "and he's in LOCATION.",
  "yes, it ’ s PRODUCT.",
  "yeah they must.",
  "lottery!",
  "that's all there is to it.",
  "i'd rather to watch.",
  "as long as i know it is safe!",
  "was it?",
  "ya that must be it.",
  "it's LANGUAGE.",
  "no, i haven ’ t.",
  "probably due to what they eat.",
  "i'd like to travel around the LOCATION.",
  "i do not either.",
  "he did not come off as particularly articulate.",
  "oh, yes, your ORG live there, don't they?",
  "im watching BUSINESS right now!",
  "then, when do you plan to get married?",
  "did you know that in 39 LOCATION in the us.",
  "he's very talented.",
  "i am not really sure to be honest.",
  "seattle huh?",
  "yeah i don't think there are too many.",
  "that's something else!",
  "what are you going to be doing?",
  "what do you FOOD to drink?",
  "you would think they would like it.",
  "i think he would have done great.",
  "yeah i wonder until when though because some have not had one",
  "yes probably mine as well now that you mention it.",
  "same with you.",
  "it tastes great.",
  "i don't think this is right.",
  "i ’ m not surprised.",
  "yes, but i think it ’ s probably for the best.",
  "yeah he is still doing BUSINESS and when he retires.",
  "that is very good.",
  "MUSIC_GENRE albums?",
  "that is good to know.",
  "call us as soon as you got home.",
  "i went to BUSINESS's and picked it out.",
  "yes, i'm from LOCATION.",
  "no, but i'd like to.",
  "i would never do that.",
  "yes, someone will be here to let you in.",
  "here.",
  "then i will avoid it.",
  "yeah i guess so",
  "we did.",
  "that was interesting to learn!",
  "it's so interesting, i like it very much.",
  "that would be the doing of the ORG.",
  "that seems really sexist.",
  "i can't wait to watch it.",
  "you shouldn ’ t be nervous about that.",
  "i love them.",
  "those FOOD sound terrible and really unhealthy.",
  "why do you want to teach at our LOCATION?",
  "he really has.",
  "so i take it you two are hitting it off?",
  "ok.we can meet halfway again.",
  "20 PRODUCT more than bandwidth.",
  "i didn't realize BUSINESS is owned by amazon!",
  "well i wouldn't mind learning some LANGUAGE.",
  "i am impressed as well.",
  "that is very fast.",
  "there we go.",
  "thank you for saying that.",
  "some by as much as 10% i heard.",
  "that's very surprising indeed.",
  "it's pretty cool.",
  "so do you like TYPE_OF_SPORT.",
  "what did you say to him?",
  "not right away, you need to decide what it is you want to do.",
  "let me know when you find out.",
  "i love to travel as well.",
  "i bet they did lol.",
  "some are entertaining, but i find most of them stupid and childish.",
  "yes, i've noticed that.",
  "no, it's not.",
  "i do not believe them.",
  "well, you are right.",
  "yes we definitely agree on that!",
  "i can burn some FOOD!",
  "oh that's really nice of you.",
  "i'd love to listen to that.",
  "i took ACADEMIC_DISCIPLINE too.",
  "they sure are.",
  "it is very curious.",
  "no.  i heard about it.",
  "i could do it from almost anywhere too.",
  "ur, you really let me down.",
  "you can ride PRODUCT there too.",
  "i am not certain.",
  "i do both!",
  "we are definetly surrounded by LOCATION",
  "yeah i have one PRODUCT.",
  "it's so nice of you.",
  "yes it is sexist and it really needs to go",
  "how he released 3 MUSIC_GENRE albums?",
  "interesting...i did not know that.",
  "right, we'll have these three.",
  "a ghost?",
  "yeah, that ’ s the one.",
  "i'll see you at the FAC at 12:30 p. m.",
  "yeah i'm sure.",
  "that is crazy to think.",
  "ok.i will write to you as soon as i get there.",
  "where do you need it to be delivered to?",
  "why is that?",
  "think i read that the wealthiest were ORG.",
  "he moved to LOCATION.",
  "it did seem that afterwards.",
  "no i find that hard to believe.",
  "you must have enjoyed yourself.",
  "at first i didn't know anything about the PRODUCT.",
  "i wouldn't be surprised if they do.",
  "i don't know i have never asked them.",
  "that sounds so cool.",
  "i guess it was PERSON.",
  "what did you like most about it?",
  "and why are you yarning now?",
  "cowboys all the way!",
  "i too am in LOCATION.",
  "well, i personally don't like then because i don't believe they are healthy.",
  "i have not heard of it.",
  "he sure does!",
  "banned for that?",
  "ok.thanks for asking me.",
  "i think it might have something to do with it blending popular MUSIC_GENRE.",
  "ya i wonder that too.",
  "i learned in LOCATION.",
  "be careful.",
  "both of them do!",
  "i've heard about them!",
  "LOCATION is up.",
  "the SPORT_TEAM",
  "well, you really didn't do all that well.",
  "do like them",
  "i have heard of those!",
  "yes it is surprising to me as well.",
  "yeah i think PERSON was supposed to star.",
  "i stopped watching regular tv.",
  "if you're not busy, do you want to come over?",
  "is PERSON the wealthiest?",
  "i think a ORG.",
  "i don't really watch much.",
  "i think w could speak some LANGUAGE.",
  "i dont know much either.",
  "i had to watch it later as i was working!!",
  "hugh young?",
  "we'll have to talk this over some more.",
  "who was advising him?",
  "i wonder how it works.",
  "ACADEMIC_DISCIPLINE is very important.",
  "i'm guilty of that as well.",
  "i would think it would corrode everything too!",
  "yes, they generally cost a little more.",
  "confirmed.",
  "the two seem so much alike though.",
  "all right, we'll come right away.",
  "yeah. MUSIC_GENRE is pretty great when you're just listening.",
  "they are interesting.",
  "that would be fun to ride!",
  "that PRODUCT looks quite big.",
  "i didn ’ t think much of it.",
  "nothing cant stop him indeed.",
  "i wonder if they choose someone serious.",
  "that is actually located in the us.",
  "it is so hard to deal with.",
  "i follow NORP.",
  "oh, yes, i almost forgot!",
  "do  you have to get your PRODUCT tailored?",
  "ok, and anything to drink?",
  "yeah and just as strong as it used to be.",
  "it is important to play tough.",
  "yeah now that you mention it.",
  "i'm quite outgoing i think.",
  "yeah i know who he is.",
  "i like to watch tv.",
  "yeah he does have a few.",
  "got to catch them all.",
  "LANGUAGE, where is that?",
  "in the dustbin!",
  "then something must be wrong with the PRODUCT.",
  "i hope you two were not traveling during the ORG shut down.",
  "i see that you're pretty talented.",
  "oh yeah that was big.",
  "that is something!!!",
  "i heard it was horrible",
  "that seems like a great WORK_OF_ART.",
  "just about!",
  "i'm with you on that at least.",
  "that sounds horrific.",
  "i think you look fantastic.",
  "yes, just a little.",
  "i dont think it should but that is why big WORK_OF_ART pay more.",
  "that must have been distracting!",
  "that's really shocking!",
  "if i remember it correctly.",
  "i already knew that.",
  "not sure i would like to buy used PRODUCT.",
  "we're located at LOCATION.",
  "i think i heard that somewhere.",
  "ok - let ’ s do that then!",
  "did you find anything?",
  "yeah i don't really watch anything on tv personally.",
  "i can ’ t believe you didn ’ t know when the EVENT were.",
  "well i live in LOCATION.",
  "i think that is sad.",
  "also interesting.",
  "that's what i did in LOCATION.",
  "in 2020?",
  "as long if it's clean i'm sure they do.",
  "she is so beautiful and elegant.",
  "yeah it was nice chatting with you so far.",
  "was he?",
  "yup",
  "i could never get into PRODUCT.",
  "the SPORT_TEAM didn't win until 2016.",
  "that's sad.",
  "i seriously don't think there is anything you can't buy on BUSINESS now.",
  "i wonder why he did that?",
  "i feel terrible now.",
  "they have that's for sure.",
  "thank you, please fill out this WORK_OF_ART for us.",
  "FOOD would be fine.",
  "no he lives in the LOCATION currently.",
  "very nice of her.",
  "that sounds very general.",
  "i saw that on PRODUCT.",
  "that's about it.",
  "did you know in LOCATION.",
  "i'm not too sure on that.",
  "i wonder if we'll see it in the SPORTS_SEASON?",
  "yes that is very fitting.",
  "i cannot believe that.",
  "that's no surprising.",
  "i wonder how rapping will evolve?",
  "PRODUCT 22",
  "and have you taken anything for it?",
  "i",
  "do you watch any tv shows?",
  "well, i personally don't like them because i don't believe that they are healthy.",
  "in the vino?",
  "i knew she was well paid but i did not know how much she receives.",
  "it's been nice talking to you.",
  "the PRODUCT may be free.",
  "i wonder if that means anything in their LANGUAGE.",
  "i will lol.",
  "yeah it is pretty nice and has a great LOCATION",
  "i wonder how long it was.",
  "well you can't miss what you never had.",
  "and how many PRODUCT did you have?",
  "yeah it is funny.",
  "that's pretty scary.",
  "he certainly was.",
  "and i wonder if they were good.",
  "it was during the 1930's.",
  "58 to be exact.",
  "well. depends on where you are.",
  "yeah it is and it is sexist too.",
  "i ’ m afraid i ’ ll be late.",
  "i needed to write it for $ 100.",
  "i remember when i first went on the PRODUCT.",
  "i think he's ok.",
  "jim!",
  "at least they are respectable.",
  "that sounds fine to me.",
  "im not sure what to make out of that.",
  "yeah it can be pretty depressing.",
  "scary!",
  "that's creepy.",
  "i do watch BUSINESS.",
  "no, she hasn't.",
  "i'm sorry, but no.",
  "i liked it but it really flopped in the uk it seems",
  "i don't think so?",
  "yeah i am looking for one right now.",
  "holy moly!",
  "i wonder if he is allergic or something because FOOD are awesome!",
  "same there.",
  "i have heard of the EVENT.",
  "i think if you're cold.",
  "it is one hundred and fifty.",
  "that's not bad at all.",
  "i'd love to see it too.",
  "in june.",
  "they would be adding to their PRODUCT i think.",
  "in LOCATION",
  "oh, sorry to have bothered you.",
  "so all of that PRODUCT will help you to pick out what to wear.",
  "that's so heartbreaking knowing that they went through that.",
  "please endorse it first.",
  "someone out there knows something.",
  "and also this FOOD is cold.",
  "something about him fighting with the PRODUCT and how one has to go",
  "do you mean in the BUSINESS?",
  "yes and he is not even mentioned in it at all",
  "i don't see what was so \"good\" about it.",
  "i prefer the PRODUCT.",
  "they have even owned BUSINESS since 1998.",
  "hmm...",
  "insane!",
  "2.263 concerts.",
  "i know the ORG are still going strong right?",
  "as i said, i'd go round the LOCATION.",
  "they must have performed so badly even the ORG sued.",
  "yes, i ' ve finished.",
  "i think i havent seen that one",
  "i don't want to.",
  "yeah i agree they are not sustainable at all.",
  "it was 700.000.",
  "they will.",
  "ok, but don't tell anyone what i said.",
  "you find this more and more on the PRODUCT.",
  "i think you may be on to something perhaps.",
  "yes, you are right.",
  "they're blue.",
  "ok, is that all?",
  "it is true.",
  "what is in it?",
  "really what is there to do in d.c?",
  "i think that is what it is.",
  "aw yes.",
  "i'd like to try something typically NORP.",
  "that is super scary indeed.",
  "i'm really sick of you.",
  "i wonder how that can be.",
  "that is a good PRODUCT for it.",
  "that would be so cool to watch.",
  "yes i don't have PRODUCT either.",
  "it does seem like it has been around longer.",
  "go for it.",
  "i don't know how you would comprehend anything reading that fast.",
  "what should i do now?",
  "i do like them.",
  "yes, we've got all the necessary PRODUCT.",
  "that's really small.",
  "you're so correct.",
  "first, can i know something about your financial ACADEMIC_DISCIPLINE?",
  "i enjoyed chatting with you too.",
  "i was wondering the same.",
  "i don't think the EVENT will go on much longer, should i ask him to call you when he is free.",
  "and i have 2 of them.",
  "would you like to have them altered?",
  "wow...how do they enforce that?",
  "i wonder if he wanted fake PRODUCT instead of cutting them down?",
  "how long do you expect to stay there?",
  "that would be useful.",
  "yes i imagine they were.",
  "i would not have turned that down!",
  "i think they would.",
  "i really like that PRODUCT.",
  "if i could speed read i could read both",
  "i heard about that ORG.",
  "twenty.",
  "what appliances?",
  "i understand what you're saying.",
  "i  know that they can help with hunting.",
  "that is good to hear!",
  "she is really talented.",
  "i honestly didn't watch yet.",
  "very creative.",
  "let me try something else",
  "i suppose so.",
  "no but i am going to try it.",
  "i don't even try to keep up.",
  "no i don't what do they do?",
  "that's pretty unique!",
  "it must have been really scary to do that.",
  "you can easily download it from their PRODUCT.",
  "i suppose when you've climbed LOCATION you need to be able to take that selfie and send it out.",
  "not very often.",
  "i had that.",
  "it was LOCATION.",
  "ok, good-bye.",
  "do you have a ANIMAL?",
  "he just might.",
  "that does sound nice!",
  "twilight?",
  "what am i supposed to do?",
  "i wonder how that manages to stay in LOCATION for that long and be only that thick.",
  "what if we are out sick?",
  "did you know they belong to WORK_OF_ART?",
  "it's 10 PRODUCT.",
  "that itself sounds very boring i'd rather shoot myself than to do that.",
  "i think its pretty cool.",
  "uh, let's keep this going, shall we?",
  "i didn't even know that!",
  "i bet that's expensive.",
  "yep that is interesting.",
  "well then, i'll keep you in the LOCATION.",
  "yeah i think you are right!",
  "i like the SPORT_TEAM as well.",
  "then just press this PRODUCT.",
  "that's stupid.",
  "ok, catch you later.",
  "it does lol.",
  "well, those WORK_OF_ART are really good.",
  "i wouldn't think so.",
  "does it have a PRODUCT?",
  "yes he is good.",
  "who would you like to talk to?",
  "me too i have to admit.",
  "i guess i didn't hear about that.",
  "i think FOOD is best.",
  "yes that is nice for those who are interested in that.",
  "at the FAC.",
  "ping.",
  "i wonder what famous ORG have played there.",
  "i didnt see too much of it.",
  "thats a great WORK_OF_ART sounds great.",
  "yeah i believe he is",
  "why do you think so ?",
  "it might be cheaper than seeing him in the BUSINESS though.",
  "i cannot bring myself to watch them really.",
  "i agree with you about that.",
  "if one was done.",
  "when can i know whether i'm accepted or not?",
  "i was surprised that it beat out PERSON.",
  "tasha mountain?",
  "yeah and they then give it to local ORG",
  "PRODUCT have evolved so much.",
  "that seems impossible.",
  "that was a nice EVENT.",
  "i don't really know any to be honest.",
  "that just doesn't seem fair!",
  "yeah i heard that too.",
  "oh 58.",
  "ok, ok, fine!",
  "wow i will have to check it out.",
  "yeah i was trying to figure that out.",
  "i ’ m sorry to hear that.",
  "well, there's nothing i can do about my PRODUCT!",
  "no, she bought them in the u.s.",
  "ah, it is clear enough to send.",
  "ive heard that there could be more than one.",
  "is it on PRODUCT?",
  "are there any WORK_OF_ART that you would like to see live?",
  "fine, i'll make it.",
  "yes, it is quite reasonable.",
  "i've seen it when i was younger.",
  "what was PERSON known for?",
  "ya i'm not sure i haven't taken one.",
  "i've never been.",
  "good boy!",
  "i suppose i could.",
  "they were such a great ORG.",
  "you are really good!",
  "not really any more",
  "hopefully so.",
  "ok.we will manage it later.",
  "i live in my uncle's FAC.",
  "that does sound super interesting.",
  "have you used the font PRODUCT",
  "did she buy them here?",
  "i bet that he probably didn't have to.",
  "in TYPE_OF_SPORT.",
  "seems difficult to me.",
  "and then what did happen?",
  "well, here are the WORK_OF_ART.",
  "speaking of other LOCATION.",
  "she said she wanted to go LANGUAGE in dating.",
  "oh okay, thank you.",
  "thats true.",
  "i wonder if it's a big as the real one.",
  "dont really like to dance.",
  "except for LOCATION.",
  "that is fantastic.",
  "well, seeing as the OCCUPATION that pulled you over isn't here, i'll let you go.",
  "i have never been diving.",
  "me too lol!",
  "i can imagine that because LOCATION is fairly small.",
  "i don't blame you.",
  "no, sir, i did not.",
  "well, i'm so glad to hear that she's doing well.",
  "i wonder how does it work.",
  "that is very different.",
  "i'm actually surprised.",
  "after never having thrown more than 30 before that SPORTS_SEASON!",
  "yes, it ’ s a small LOCATION.",
  "i think i have read about that.",
  "and your EVENT?",
  "that's always joked about.",
  "i do not envy them.",
  "yes, i enjoy working with ORG.",
  "have you read it.",
  "that would be hilarious but very fitting too!",
  "and that was back in 1895.",
  "there is some LAW.",
  "i don't mind walking.",
  "they probably would.",
  "well, i also have...",
  "they seem to be up to something.",
  "isn't that dangerous though?",
  "no but i want to see that!",
  "the more you own.",
  "here you are, madam.",
  "i have watched.",
  "she's another MUSIC_GENRE great.",
  "yeah they are branching it seems.",
  "we all think that.",
  "i don't know but it would be great if they did.",
  "that is so impressive.",
  "that's huge.",
  "i actually didn't.",
  "i am going to research that.",
  "yes, it is.",
  "i can't even begin to guess.",
  "i'm afraid she's out.",
  "yeah they are interesting.",
  "i used to like them.",
  "yeah that is pretty transparent.",
  "you are single now, but what will you do when you get married?",
  "TYPE_OF_SPORT is very popular.",
  "they can?",
  "they are now selling them at BUSINESS.",
  "that sounds like a very high LOCATION definetely.",
  "i remember seeing that!",
  "ya.",
  "that's what i am worried about.",
  "in the WORK_OF_ART really?",
  "i apologize for that.",
  "if i taught you how to do it, i'm sure you could solve it.",
  "i applied online.",
  "that would be very kind of you.",
  "i hope he can come later.",
  "oh, they look nice.",
  "yes, i'd like some FOOD.",
  "that is my favorite WORK_OF_ART.",
  "you owe $ 24.50.",
  "yeah it sure would be.",
  "tripping?",
  "yeah always fun!",
  "the better they can study the more they can prevent.",
  "why don't we go to a EVENT instead?",
  "i did not.",
  "so when will it be here then?",
  "when do you usually require the new OCCUPATION to start?",
  "i actually wouldn't mind trying.",
  "the ORG certainly didn't come up with that one.",
  "that's what i heard too.",
  "that will probably be quite expensive, but the more you pay for the PRODUCT, the longer it'll last and the better it'll look.",
  "that's very clear.",
  "i agree with you - it was ironic.",
  "i love floyd!",
  "he was also in FAC in 2017.",
  "just relax.",
  "i wonder if he will keep going or retire.",
  "no. not mine either but they are always competitive.",
  "no i do not i play the PRODUCT though",
  "wow not sure i would want to get on that.",
  "i can fix those for you.",
  "i will take ten.",
  "you mean PRODUCT isn't included?",
  "you can take no. 2 PRODUCT.",
  "that is really odd.",
  "i thought you knew.",
  "i thought the current OCCUPATION would be the richest.",
  "i'm not sure, but she probably won't remember if she has!",
  "was it really?",
  "and he was 85!",
  "i could not agree more!",
  "oh wow he must have been a very smart OCCUPATION.",
  "i hate flying.",
  "did you really buy a tv from them?",
  "probably not for awhile.",
  "yeah you do have to learn.",
  "it  is.",
  "to each their own.",
  "i am trying to call a BUSINESS.",
  "i guess it made him mad and motivated!",
  "that's just crazy!",
  "i'd like to send it by regular PRODUCT.",
  "i dont play it",
  "and you still buy him new PRODUCT?",
  "wow i guess that is how they combat NORP too",
  "i guess i do too!",
  "sounds very nice!",
  "neither does for PERSON.",
  "brooke!",
  "i do not watch much tv.",
  "not sure when it came out.",
  "would you like anything else with your PRODUCT?",
  "you too",
  "they might understand.",
  "i thought so too.",
  "i used to live in dc.",
  "yes he only wanted to promote NORP.",
  "will there be anything else?",
  "whoa!  could you imagine that here in the LOCATION?",
  "that would be quite sad.",
  "true story lol .",
  "ok.i'll turn it on.",
  "i'm happy to help.",
  "hahaha yes!",
  "oh, all right.",
  "yes i guess he is talented overall in many ACADEMIC_DISCIPLINE",
  "that's pretty fishy.",
  "i like gardening.",
  "would you like to ask me anything?",
  "yes, he's married.",
  "i'm guilty of multitasking with multiple PRODUCT as well!",
  "i would like to know if there are any.",
  "i don't think he will be here to find out if it keeps working.",
  "please give me some FOOD.",
  "it is good to see them working together.",
  "just wondering apparently he's in LOCATION.",
  "that is super interesting.",
  "i did not know that and that seems kinda pointless.",
  "what else do i have to do?",
  "haven't you heard?",
  "yeah that was interesting-",
  "i like it more.",
  "just recently.",
  "that sounds like a really boring PRODUCT.",
  "i'm guessing she was just taking it in.",
  "in 2013.",
  "what were they doing when you called?",
  "your FOOD will be delivered as soon as it's all ready.",
  "i forgot to say in TYPE_OF_SPORT.",
  "they wont be able to get past the ORG",
  "oh, i have got it.",
  "apparently they do.",
  "yeah a whole WORK_OF_ART i agree.",
  "along the same LOCATION.",
  "489 3362 1978.",
  "that's sweet.",
  "the fourth.",
  "i really don't want to go into the LOCATION, i feel afraid of it.",
  "has your PRODUCT been filled yet?",
  "how much do i need for this WORK_OF_ART?",
  "i think it would be pretty awesome.",
  "to be honest i'm not interested in TYPE_OF_SPORT.",
  "all right, then.",
  "though that would be entertaining.",
  "wow i wonder if it any good though.",
  "ok, that is reasonable.",
  "that  is surprising!",
  "how about some PRODUCT?",
  "it is a very entertaining TYPE_OF_SPORT to play and watch.",
  "same here.",
  "yeah, you did.",
  "well i PRODUCT.",
  "i hear they are over the LOCATION!",
  "i also like TYPE_OF_SPORT.",
  "that sounds almost like an LOCATION.",
  "i'll check it for you.",
  "well when you get defeated by slipping on your own FOOD.",
  "i have not actually just the NATION one.",
  "i would guess so.",
  "yeah i hopefully shouldn't play too late.",
  "what did they rap about.",
  "thats unbelievable",
  "i believe that you're correct.",
  "yes, can you put it in a plastic PRODUCT?",
  "that is exactly what i was thinking.",
  "be yourself and be honest.",
  "very few keep it up.",
  "although they make more than i did.",
  "no, i think that i should just go home because i have some ACADEMIC_DISCIPLINE there.",
  "i was reading that.",
  "yes, i have.",
  "it's $ 25.",
  "all right, i will start working now.",
  "oh, well.",
  "FOOD please.",
  "i wonder exactly what is so bad about it.",
  "yeah i wonder that as well.",
  "it does seem invasive.",
  "just now we both thought it would be fine.",
  "no i never knew that...",
  "how would we manage it though?",
  "no. did they do something bad?",
  "yeah because he really liked WORK_OF_ART",
  "so many it's hard to choose.",
  "it was good chatting with you too!",
  "that is funny and it was outlawed.",
  "oh, i get it.",
  "i have seen it!",
  "that would be nice.",
  "you definitely should.",
  "didn't know that either!",
  "i do watch it",
  "i don't think i've heard of that.",
  "WORK_OF_ART too!",
  "i would like to hear it.",
  "yeah i know there are LAW now.",
  "i guess thats true.",
  "how did you get involved in something like that?",
  "i didn't realize she was NATION.",
  "not to mention graphic WORK_OF_ART.",
  "sure, i'll get it for you.",
  "was it expensive?",
  "i don't think they would.",
  "i've never heard of him but i want to know more!",
  "i'm not even sure if i've even heard of it.",
  "possibly but ANIMAL are pretty smart regardless.",
  "we?",
  "i am kind of surprised there wasn't one before.",
  "that's very strange.",
  "i don ’ t slurp my FOOD.",
  "it will be hard at first, but i think i can do it.",
  "i think there were different SPORTS_LEAGUE originally.",
  "well, i think you may be overreacting.",
  "somewhat can be addictive to watch.",
  "i want it registered.",
  "that sounds neat!",
  "sounds fishy.",
  "that is true though.",
  "it lulls them to sleep.",
  "you can apparently vote for anything.",
  "yeah that would be pretty wild to go back then and see what was considered funny.",
  "that truly is.",
  "it was nice talking to you!",
  "yes, this PRODUCT is very good.",
  "i doubt she could retain any of it PRODUCT.",
  "no. should i?",
  "i can only imagine what 2020 is going to be like.",
  "it was also good chatting with you!",
  "i know that FOOD.",
  "neither of us is very religious, so we decided not to get married there.",
  "it has not really been long enough.",
  "yeah not sure what they do with all that LOCATION",
  "they must be so rich from that.",
  "well, please sing one that ’ s not sad.",
  "you could just use PRODUCT",
  "that would be crazy to live forever.",
  "i wonder how they do that so we might be able to help more",
  "i do not believe that.",
  "that is too bad for him.",
  "it really seems like he did.",
  "i also like the BUSINESS.",
  "PERSON i think.",
  "they are in everything aren't they?",
  "yeah that is creative of him.",
  "i could too.",
  "how are your FOOD?",
  "he's a WORK_OF_ART.",
  "PRODUCT iron eh?",
  "here!",
  "i'm sorry we won't do so for a new OCCUPATION.",
  "i didn't think of it.",
  "i wonder how it got there.",
  "wow really?",
  "much better.",
  "i did no know that!",
  "oh, nice.",
  "they have anything you want.",
  "yes it's mostly negative.",
  "i guess while the WORK_OF_ART hasn't changed much.",
  "so does that mean you still play it?",
  "could you please tell me why?",
  "is that it?",
  "yes and they are huge.",
  "he once said.",
  "i do, but it still does not cover everything.",
  "i've heard that and i don't remember ever seeing that one.",
  "why do you think is so interesting?",
  "are they on PRODUCT?",
  "i am glad they did.",
  "i wasn't referring to an PRODUCT.",
  "yes because WORK_OF_ART is colorblind but can see blue",
  "yes, i understand what to do.",
  "what do you think about the SPORT_TEAM running back?",
  "yeah it's certainly interesting!",
  "yeah i agree with that.",
  "hmm what is a PRODUCT?",
  "yes it was very fun!",
  "no, not at all.",
  "well, how about like this?",
  "maybe so we can identify them as belong to us.",
  "yeah it has certainly taken over everything.",
  "actually i do not.",
  "no. usually use PRODUCT.",
  "i did and i didn't like it",
  "i do like wearing them.",
  "4 % is too low, i think.",
  "you and me both!",
  "i did not realize that",
  "indeed it wasn't!",
  "oh. right.",
  "ok, 400 PRODUCT please.",
  "i think i know what you're talking about.",
  "i'm a little nervous.",
  "oh, come on.",
  "i wonder if he ever traveled to LOCATION.",
  "i'm thinking it is.",
  "yes and i dont like him.",
  "yeah that is so cool that they were able to do that.",
  "before you go.",
  "i think they are ok being fictional.",
  "i don't know them very well.",
  "im sure he could afford to go through as many PRODUCT as he could possibly wear out.",
  "but we do have a compact or an PRODUCT if you ’ d like.",
  "you are quite right.",
  "i didn't thats cool.",
  "it's very thoughtful of you.",
  "i guess if they were cheap enough.",
  "that won't help us.",
  "i could have been.",
  "unfortunately, we do.",
  "she is a multi-talented OCCUPATION.",
  "i wonder who would win in a potential EVENT.",
  "the FOOD will burn.",
  "maybe not.",
  "i guess you can't have everything, can you?",
  "er, is it cabbage?",
  "that would make me work on it a little more...",
  "it would be easy to be afraid of them.",
  "well, i want to become just like PERSON.",
  "it's lovely.",
  "those i'm sure are pretty good.",
  "i was pretty sad.",
  "that ’ s expensive.",
  "i think that the PRODUCT are hollow because they are lighter.",
  "yeah she pretty cool in it.",
  "do you have a ANIMAL.",
  "i used to be really interested in that.",
  "a fantasy congress?",
  "i am not sure why it's necessary to remake between us and uk.",
  "yes and did get used so that is good.",
  "i sure am happy it isn't banned now.",
  "sure, he's ready to be friendly with anyone.",
  "i can't recall that ORG?",
  "happy anniversary!",
  "yeah that is cool to me.",
  "it isn't all that humid yet.",
  "they probably just enjoy the MUSIC_GENRE now.",
  "i guess he slipped them PRODUCT.",
  "no i didn't know that.",
  "im sure its possible.",
  "no i am not sure.",
  "so ive heard.",
  "a left-handed qb is rare.",
  "sounds like the SPORTS_EVENT.",
  "yeah that is good.",
  "what do you think about PERSON?",
  "that's unreal.",
  "i ’ m glad you understand.",
  "he was fortunate.",
  "let's see, can i get some fried FOOD, please?",
  "i did know that actually!",
  "yeah. PRODUCT seems to be everywhere now.",
  "that would be interesting to watch.",
  "it's a BUSINESS.",
  "i do not think she used bad LANGUAGE.",
  "i do remember that first PRODUCT with mj",
  "i'm working on it!",
  "yeah and he spent less than $30",
  "yes i mostly listen to PRODUCT myself.",
  "yeah and two of them are really old.",
  "ok.and would you please get me some hot FOOD, too?",
  "oh i do.",
  "who would have thought that.",
  "what else did she tell you?",
  "ya he seems like a nice OCCUPATION.",
  "don't think so.",
  "he is quite popular.",
  "2012!",
  "ok.i'll take one.",
  "i wonder how you get paid for that.",
  "they use those as a PRODUCT apparently.",
  "just as usual, you know.",
  "ok, that would be great.",
  "i might start using my PRODUCT less then.",
  "are you busy now?",
  "i would guess so?",
  "yes, he did the same to me.",
  "because i won't let it fail.",
  "i hear you on that.",
  "ok.please get in.",
  "that would be crazy.",
  "no i did not know that i would hope not.",
  "i was impressed when i first saw that on tv.",
  "are you available on sunday?",
  "i wonder whether he read them aloud or silently.",
  "im addicted.",
  "no, i always back up my PRODUCT.",
  "i think PERSON only right.",
  "even going so far as to dub it in LANGUAGE!",
  "i think i have read that before yes.",
  "anyway, it is worth trying.",
  "yes, i would.",
  "yeah that would be cool.",
  "i ’ m calling from BUSINESS.",
  "he is an amazing OCCUPATION for sure.",
  "that's really sincere of them.",
  "i like some of them.",
  "only 3?",
  "they're much better",
  "they must have tested them.",
  "they pay well enough.",
  "no, she didn't.",
  "it's all right.",
  "how about rose?",
  "what do you plan on buying?",
  "no i didn't what happened?",
  "ah, got it.",
  "i wont even catch it there either.",
  "that's really supportive!",
  "go.",
  "i can not and how ironic it is that he's an WORK_OF_ART.",
  "yes, it fits all right now.",
  "top secret?",
  "ok.i'll be right back with you.",
  "i wouldnt mind that.",
  "that's so simple.",
  "that i actually do know about.",
  "it ’ s infuriating.",
  "no. wasnt it outrageous.",
  "sure, i'll try my best.",
  "that is pretty cool!!",
  "i feel for the NATION.",
  "yeah he seems like a nice OCCUPATION.",
  "no, probably not.",
  "oh wow that is very surprising.",
  "yes, very much.",
  "very cool to know.",
  "maybe he made her to fat and it was unbecoming for her as a WORK_OF_ART to be represented like that",
  "they must be really massive for sure.",
  "it is 3d also.",
  "it's a great EVENT.",
  "haven't seen that.",
  "yeah they are ok.",
  "t",
  "oh thats good.",
  "yes i love house!",
  "why indeed.",
  "yes and it is also very green and beautiful.",
  "we went out in our PRODUCT.",
  "i do watch some TYPE_OF_SPORT.",
  "yeah it is so popular in LOCATION that they are surprised about that .",
  "oh i am sorry",
  "fdr.",
  "why did you lie to me in the PRODUCT?",
  "no, but if you can think of anything else, just get it.",
  "all is best now, isn ’ t it?",
  "it could be but  but they still call it WORK_OF_ART which is cool",
  "yes to both of those!",
  "i would be interested in watching that",
  "yes, that annoys me too.",
  "no who?",
  "maybe that was her.",
  "ok, please wrap it for me first.",
  "i have to admit that i very rarely ever read them.",
  "let me check my PRODUCT.",
  "i think it was PERSON!",
  "i definitely fall out of that 7% LOCATION.",
  "if it's cold im warming my PRODUCT up.",
  "did you ever play PRODUCT on there?",
  "it sure doesnt.",
  "have you ever worn them?",
  "that's not cool.",
  "oh i absolutely agree.",
  "yeah a OCCUPATION.",
  "i am actually.",
  "yeah i just don't know.",
  "i'm going to check that out.",
  "the domestic ANIMAL are mostly carnivore.",
  "thats really awesome of them.",
  "it's funny what we gut hung up on.",
  "no why not",
  "is she cursed.",
  "the second one.",
  "yes i have seen some.",
  "i bet he is mad at himself for that.",
  "but don't worry.",
  "maybe so...",
  "yes, over there to your LOCATION.",
  "well i don't go out nude",
  "i saw it but never thought it was that funny.",
  "i enjoy reading.",
  "i am sure it went viral.",
  "that's horrible that that happened.",
  "he really does his best for the ORG.",
  "that's so funny.",
  "can it go in an LOCATION?",
  "that said.",
  "i never knew that",
  "oh i heard about him.",
  "no i am not good.",
  "you certainly need that.",
  "ok.let me try it.",
  "ya i'll have to check it out.",
  "yeah...i'm so boggled i can hardly chat anymore.",
  "thats what it was!",
  "i'm sure he will be.",
  "i will have to check that one out as well.",
  "okay now i understand.",
  "i hardly dare call the ORG.",
  "i really don't know who that is.",
  "oh i'm positive of that.",
  "i think the BUSINESS has done quite well.",
  "that is quite sad.",
  "i wonder if that is because that is what we grew up with and are nostalgic or if they are simply better in PRODUCT?",
  "may i please see id?",
  "this seems to be my PRODUCT.",
  "that's free.",
  "we will have this one first and order something else later.",
  "do you know who the top 3 wealthiest OCCUPATION were?",
  "ok.but i hope it won't take too long.",
  "here is the PRODUCT.",
  "ya they beat SPORT_TEAM.",
  "indeed i agree.",
  "you're actually standing above it.",
  "it may be worse than it seems.",
  "oh,",
  "what am i going to do?",
  "i didnt like it.",
  "whatever would you like to drink?",
  "i think you're hallucinating!",
  "i do play some.",
  "i always was too.",
  "oh yeah...",
  "i wonder if he could play the world's smallest PRODUCT.",
  "yeah i might check it out.",
  "he said he didn't want to have to get to know everybody again.",
  "FOOD will be right with you.",
  "but hey.",
  "will that be all then?",
  "she does.",
  "oh that is odd",
  "it is for my ORG who swim competitively.",
  "the man and his pop albums?",
  "i was surprised to read that too!",
  "i bought some advanced ACADEMIC_DISCIPLINE.",
  "how much is it going to cost?",
  "that was BUSINESS's back in 1975.",
  "great, okay. \"",
  "i'll have my FOOD well-done, please.",
  "i didn't know that until now!",
  "they sound pretty cool.",
  "that is unfortunately.",
  "he certainly is very rich.",
  "EVENT is tuesday.",
  "i need all of my PRODUCT right away.",
  "go make a FOOD.",
  "he would be good.",
  "they should have googled it.",
  "i read that and want to know who actually dragged a PRODUCT up there.",
  "what did he do for restoring the SPORTS_EVENT?",
  "that is pretty smart of you.",
  "i like him .",
  "i would imagine he must be.",
  "right, that's fine.",
  "i actually like the SPORT_TEAM.",
  "i think it sounds excessive too.",
  "i wanted to.",
  "i remember them mailing the PRODUCT but didn't remember when they started.",
  "have you ever been addicted to social PRODUCT?",
  "i'm honestly not sure.",
  "i understand why.",
  "i wonder why they did that!",
  "would you please follow me, please?",
  "i  didnt know that.",
  "i think it might.",
  "that's absurd.",
  "i've gotten six, i think.",
  "i want to transfer $ 200.",
  "it was john wilkes booth!",
  "well, i've invited them for FOOD.",
  "the BUSINESS is even higher at 78%.",
  "try drinking some FOOD.",
  "i do not either and don't care for them now lol.",
  "yeah i dont think its as popular.",
  "if he had the 10% would be worth 8.62 billion!",
  "just did my best.",
  "oh that's nice.",
  "i'm not sure that i have either.",
  "i think they will do well.",
  "yes he is very good.",
  "that will do.",
  "that sounds very probable.",
  "i will try that.",
  "is it near here?",
  "you can keep the WORK_OF_ART, but you should keep it away from me.",
  "just pay the LAW and you can do what you want i guess.",
  "oh yeah you're right.",
  "it will be hard if not impossible to do...",
  "it ’ s great.",
  "that is true i think they do.",
  "i tried.",
  "i really want to be but am not.",
  "i believe it'll be very expensive.",
  "ok.it's PRODUCT.",
  "i believe for a while.",
  "why don't you try and give it up?",
  "i should definitely see for myself then.",
  "they might need him",
  "yeah. 2005 is not that long ago",
  "i think i have read that before.",
  "you speak LANGUAGE very well.",
  "i also love cooking.",
  "i play mobile PRODUCT.",
  "ok, let's go then!",
  "i have a ANIMAL.",
  "he actually got in to ORG.",
  "the FAC?",
  "even that's a little creepy.",
  "yes i've heard of them.",
  "yeah it sounds like it.",
  "don't get ahead of yourself.",
  "( they get everything ready )",
  "what did they rename?",
  "i honestly don't know.",
  "please change your PRODUCT first!",
  "yeah it is kind of ironic.",
  "i've played some.",
  "i'm not quite positive.",
  "yeah i very much agree with you.",
  "yep every once in a while.",
  "i wonder who plays there.",
  "we start on monday.",
  "talented comedian!",
  "i have to work.",
  "i wonder if that is really true?",
  "this is the first FAC.",
  "i mean very short, shorter than it is now.",
  "that's exactly how i felt.",
  "wow i didn't know that!",
  "i can not even imagine!",
  "no, i usually have to stand.",
  "how does that work.",
  "i think maybe because they are small.",
  "i might need it if they do.",
  "it's for myself.",
  "i graduated from LOCATION.",
  "i heard that about him.",
  "that is funny to think about.",
  "no, i don't know where that is.",
  "for some.",
  "actually PERSON is not in there.",
  "i hope they did.",
  "i think i'd better.",
  "i did not know PERSON was in it!",
  "sometimes i do.",
  "they have cancelled more than 100 since 1989",
  "i actually did know that.",
  "just don't stay out too late.",
  "have you decided on anything?",
  "same too you",
  "i do use BUSINESS.",
  "no i didn't i only heard he played TYPE_OF_SPORT.",
  "that would be weird.",
  "i still am shocked.",
  "yes he ran for POLITICAL_PARTY.",
  "PERSON is my favorite.",
  "sounds pretty good.",
  "i am trying to figure out how they would obtain a PRODUCT and who would install it for them.",
  "i was never on it.",
  "that sounds really racist.",
  "i don't know but if it's in or around LOCATION they probably do.",
  "i've heard about that too!",
  "how about your ORG?",
  "it's supposed to start at about eight.",
  "isn't that because it doesn't tilt and rotates PRODUCT-wise?",
  "i wonder why they ever bought it.",
  "that sounds painful.",
  "3448-2691- 6429-34.",
  "well, i don't feel right about it.",
  "i bet he will come.",
  "to watch what?",
  "it reminds me of the ORG.",
  "if you know any of their ORG.",
  "i just hope he doesn't start bragging again!",
  "great!",
  "what do you feel like having?",
  "isn't that funny!",
  "what special ACADEMIC_DISCIPLINE?",
  "that could get really expensive quick!",
  "that is awful!",
  "do you know ORG?",
  "yep they just want to be entertained.",
  "before or during his OCCUPATION.",
  "yeah that is because they are required by LAW.",
  "that was nice of them.",
  "i think that might work for me as well.",
  "that is pretty cool too.",
  "yeah there are so many.",
  "that's fine, but i'm not paying for it.",
  "oh i already saw they are doing all that .",
  "i have to watch that.",
  "it keeps turning off on it's own.",
  "don't worry about it, but thank you very much.",
  "it is a small LOCATION though.",
  "hmmm i never noticed that.",
  "i like talking to you too.",
  "because you're from a foreign LOCATION.",
  "perfect!",
  "i drive a PRODUCT.",
  "i merely know how to send the direct WORK_OF_ART.",
  "in september 2010.",
  "that's nice of them",
  "i like it too.",
  "i guess its not.",
  "when they're asleep.",
  "how about your LANGUAGE?",
  "yeah and they get paid very very little less than $6000",
  "its about 33% right?",
  "he didn't talk much because he didn't know LANGUAGE very well.",
  "yeah, thank you for telling me.",
  "it was passable...",
  "really seems like it's been around forever.",
  "i wonder how that happens.",
  "it's really weird that in the uk though.",
  "i know i had heard that.",
  "it would probably trend all over the PRODUCT if they made one",
  "i remember when she moved there.",
  "i think he just does not like BUSINESS.",
  "yeah that would be really nice.",
  "pretty terrible.",
  "have you got a new one?",
  "and she is thin, isn ’ t she?",
  "i wonder how old that is?",
  "we do?",
  "its getting ridiculous.",
  "yeah apparently they have owned it since 1998",
  "i have just never got into it myself.",
  "i think that's great.",
  "that is just incredible.",
  "that was only the first OCCUPATION.",
  "what PRODUCT will you have?",
  "who is the director?",
  "i may see WORK_OF_ART.",
  "no but that is really cool.",
  "i'm signing off.",
  "how do you want to your PRODUCT trimmed?",
  "that is pretty funny.",
  "they didn't anticipate that BUSINESS would be worth $104 billion by 2012",
  "i typically listen to the PRODUCT.",
  "yes i hope it is being used to save it.",
  "well, what are you going to do now?",
  "i would not have guessed that.",
  "i just learned about it.",
  "that seems really dumb.",
  "no, but we're trying to contact them.",
  "theifs!",
  "ok, then, hope you feel better soon.",
  "yeah it seems unreal and would be actually nice to see that.",
  "how did they manage to stay standing?",
  "yes, i know, but she's dangerous.",
  "well, the PRODUCT in themselves are very simple.",
  "it would have been interesting.",
  "i was shocked with that one.",
  "well do you ever listen to him talk?",
  "isn't that nice to be special?",
  "that's crazy for sure.",
  "i bet it is nice there.",
  "that doesn't seem very PRODUCT appropriate.",
  "they do seem to be easily offended but i suppose it's because they are so opionated!",
  "sure, what can i do for you?",
  "yes and i thought it was good but apparently in the uk it flopped",
  "i got it from BUSINESS's.",
  "i can swim well.",
  "2.",
  "yeah, sounds like something i should definitely do.",
  "is she writing new hp WORK_OF_ART or was it over ?",
  "i guess there is no gov't LAW.",
  "yeah i still don't get but what do i know.",
  "yes it's very sad.",
  "nope i don't either.",
  "if it did.",
  "there is a thin LOCATION.",
  "what about TYPE_OF_SPORT.",
  "that's worth looking into to find out!",
  "it was PERSON .",
  "at our local LOCATION.",
  "they sure could!",
  "most of all there.",
  "i need to withdraw $ 300.",
  "what do they have in common?",
  "never heard of it.",
  "yep i'm serious.",
  "but i really needed to be quick.",
  "could you imagine if that happened in the u.s.?",
  "please drive slowly.",
  "PERSON is pretty funny also.",
  "yes, it is really hard.",
  "i mean i do sometimes use the tv for BUSINESS but that is about it",
  "that sounds just perfect.",
  "so many.",
  "that ’ s not going to happen.",
  "i'll try them on.",
  "yes, i have prepared.",
  "i wonder if he thinks that's worked out for him.",
  "it does make you wonder.",
  "no i don't think so",
  "i have never been to washington d.c.",
  "that would hard to beat.",
  "that sounds really unfair.",
  "well, if you're not seeing anyone, maybe we could...",
  "what time is now?",
  "what BUSINESS are you going to?",
  "long or short?",
  "that's really great.",
  "how about PRODUCT-436-8976?",
  "yes they're pretty good.",
  "that explains it i guess.",
  "yeah i wonder if that means something else in their LANGUAGE too though",
  "thank you, OCCUPATION.",
  "that surprises me really in TYPE_OF_SPORT.",
  "i don't really want to.",
  "hmm i don't know.",
  "it is unnecessary.",
  "i haven ’ t decided yet.",
  "that's refreshing...",
  "i'm not all that old.",
  "no, i don ’ t.",
  "i never knew he could dance",
  "yeah. just saw that.",
  "that's what i was saying.",
  "i cant play TYPE_OF_SPORT.",
  "i find PRODUCT interesting.",
  "very easy to break into.",
  "by slipping on his own FOOD",
  "i do like MUSIC_GENRE!",
  "i do not know completely.",
  "i would think that was fair.",
  "they kept up until 2005.",
  "i really hope that you didn't expect me to pay you for this.",
  "that's neat!",
  "some of it but not a PRODUCT.",
  "he's very nice, actually, but rather eccentric.",
  "233-331-8828.",
  "yes i dislike walking so much in the FAC.",
  "that cannot be good.",
  "we can always ask him.",
  "it would be cool to try the vr PRODUCT.",
  "i didn't know that either until just now about him.",
  "yes i need to speak to a LOCATION about this.",
  "i bet they do!",
  "realy?",
  "here in the LOCATION.",
  "oh that sounds amazing.",
  "what do you think of the ne ORG?",
  "yes it can come up to be $300 because the LOCATION are tolled",
  "at 9:36.",
  "why would you park in LOCATION?",
  "could be ;)",
  "you might also want to upgrade your PRODUCT because it is pretty outdated now.",
  "i use it a little.",
  "how many PRODUCT of yours do you want me to wash?",
  "from one to two.",
  "i dont know about taking it that far.",
  "why can't i just stay up until i fall asleep?",
  "i applied for a OCCUPATION there.",
  "she is eight.",
  "i don't think there's one around here.",
  "i wonder if it works.",
  "he was a staunch NORP",
  "i never cared for ORG.",
  "is that for real?",
  "now that's a little scary.",
  "that sounds probably about right!",
  "think so.",
  "i agree and you know they profile whether consciously or subconsciously",
  "yeah apparently they bought it back in 1998",
  "yes he thiks that we should just eat more diverse FOOD",
  "yes, and i hope that it does.",
  "sure, here it is...",
  "lol  nice!",
  "i would have gone directly too.",
  "i'm not laughing at you.",
  "that sounds funny!",
  "i'm surprised you know so much about it.",
  "i guess i believe it.",
  "sure, thank you.",
  "do you play an PRODUCT?",
  "and their PRODUCT are not expensive.",
  "it sounds like it.",
  "that would be correct.",
  "he would probably be fun.",
  "i'm not sure how that would work now.",
  "i guess youre right.",
  "great, is it convenient if i visit you this EVENT?",
  "i find that really interesting!",
  "did you know 39 of 50 LOCATION.",
  "maybe LOCATION too.",
  "yeah maybe that is how it works.",
  "yep i love the FOOD there!",
  "i think his WORK_OF_ART are great to be honest.",
  "they are along with PERSON.",
  "i wonder why he's named after the FOOD!",
  "can you imagine her promoting FOOD?",
  "i can't think of any that would be good at it.",
  "constantly.",
  "i played the original PRODUCT and i am so surprised that they discontinued it in 2003.",
  "i find some of the random ACADEMIC_DISCIPLINE really interesting too.",
  "it's not the latest PRODUCT, is it?",
  "yes i am totally agree.",
  "i love ACADEMIC_DISCIPLINE.",
  "i like some of it.",
  "i agree he should get a LAW!",
  "at least they are willing to change!",
  "it's really worth seeing.",
  "why would you say that?",
  "oh, i forgot about it.",
  "i guess they broke into about four BUSINESS.",
  "it has been great!",
  "yay!!",
  "they sure are complex WORK_OF_ART.",
  "yeah you're right.",
  "that i know.",
  "i heard about it too",
  "hell, i don't care.",
  "he says they're not passing enough.",
  "that was something i found really interesting as well.",
  "just some FOOD, please.",
  "i know that's what i thought too.",
  "okay, i'm sorry.",
  "i've never seen it happen but would be neat to see.",
  "he is a different WORK_OF_ART.",
  "i do remember.",
  "yeah they have been.",
  "yes but they started in 1989 so that is not too many",
  "i used to when i first started using BUSINESS.",
  "that must make PERSON so angry!",
  "yes, but not too stiff, right?",
  "it's on BUSINESS.",
  "i wonder what he is thinking there.",
  "why don't you grill it?",
  "i think it's cool how it came to be.",
  "ah no i didn't know that.",
  "i still find it hard to believe that it is the world's most popular TYPE_OF_SPORT.",
  "not where i lived.",
  "you do know that it's absolutely freezing out, don't you?",
  "i ’ ll work here as long as you expect me to.",
  "i wonder if it was any good.",
  "waterphone?",
  "i heard that too.",
  "i think that is very cool.",
  "do you think she actually knows what she is reading?",
  "a chance?",
  "thank you, sir, i'm sure i will.",
  "oh wow that's crazy.",
  "which LOCATION do you attend?",
  "thank you, i got it.",
  "that's intense.",
  "i guess it was.",
  "would you like to have a FOOD?",
  "i'm going to do that as soon as possible.",
  "what do you think of the ORG ?",
  "i have downloaded one, but it still can't be listened.",
  "o.k.",
  "that look really needs to go away.",
  "yes, i am really excited.",
  "this is terrible.",
  "i think i knew that.",
  "ok, you can take that from my PRODUCT.",
  "maybe she enjoys watching you play.",
  "that is just dumb to me.",
  "looks like he is going to be their OCCUPATION.",
  "this is funny.",
  "i've heard he's running.",
  "why.",
  "me as well.",
  "i do not really.",
  "you shall go easy on her.",
  "well, i'll take them.",
  "199999!",
  "that is.",
  "i wouldn't mind having one myself...",
  "yes, that's what i think.",
  "when was the BUSINESS founded?",
  "that ’ s what i thought.",
  "can you make it much cheaper?",
  "so is it played by PRODUCT then?",
  "yeah that would be so cool to see how they did it.",
  "i think you might be right.",
  "that is a fun little WORK_OF_ART.",
  "that's comforting!",
  "i think that is very interesting.",
  "oh, that will be uncomfortable for them.",
  "that's human ACADEMIC_DISCIPLINE.",
  "have you ever watched CHAMPIONSHIP?",
  "and you shouldn't miss the FAC.",
  "i see thats interesting.",
  "i imagine they were made with thicker PRODUCT.",
  "i wonder if anyone in the BUSINESS has ever done it?",
  "well, i visited their PRODUCT and read up on what they do.",
  "i forgot about that.",
  "here they are.",
  "i think i could see it initially.",
  "yes, there are something good and informative.",
  "that ' ok.",
  "it.",
  "about how much were you planning to spend?",
  "it must be a magical PRODUCT.",
  "it was nice talking with you.",
  "but it doesn't have a PRODUCT.",
  "oh that would be amazing.",
  "i figured so.",
  "ok by me.",
  "i wonder how much PERSON.",
  "i'm not too sure.",
  "yeah.that is strange.",
  "it's cool that they price PRODUCT amazon!",
  "i forgot about those.",
  "i just visioned it.",
  "hmmm never heard of it.",
  "i'm fine.",
  "it amazing how NORP get passed along.",
  "nope i think they should do that more.",
  "but he didn't even try!",
  "yes, i am.",
  "who doesn't browse PRODUCT now and again",
  "i have an BUSINESS but i do not use it regularly.",
  "i guess you're right.",
  "right?!?!",
  "i saw that as well.",
  "so why aren't you driving it?",
  "i heard that you moved to LOCATION.",
  "the motorcycle?",
  "did you know that the CHAMPIONSHIP has been going on since 1903?",
  "they must have done it manually.",
  "don ’ t mention it.",
  "president banana!",
  "i just want to have a FOOD, i think.",
  "ok.i look forward to working with you.",
  "and it wasn't even once!",
  "when can i do that?",
  "it can't be done.",
  "sure, where would you like to go?",
  "i really need to catch up on it.",
  "i did not but once two of them get stuck together there is no separating them",
  "aww!",
  "...so... it's going to be a BUSINESS based ?",
  "it was something.",
  "why just think it's interesting that FAC was first constructed back in 1801.",
  "ya i don't know.",
  "well, i hope he starts feeling better.",
  "i wouldn't want to work in there.",
  "it ’ s still too much.",
  "neat!",
  "well, what would you like to talk to me about?",
  "this is not common FOOD.",
  "i was happy to hear something positive coming out of LOCATION.",
  "now i'm confused again!",
  "that's surprising!",
  "i would like to learn how to read PRODUCT.",
  "was anything taken?",
  "just plug in a peripheral cd or floppy PRODUCT and you're ready to go!",
  "yeah didn't he ban something that had to do with EVENT?",
  "i would not think so!!!",
  "well that is ok.",
  "perhaps we can evolve it eventually.",
  "at least friday is going to be cool.",
  "he didnt?",
  "it should always be in the left LOCATION.",
  "game time!",
  "because then you could watch whenever you wanted to.",
  "that is pretty crazy.",
  "that is weird",
  "it could.",
  "just once.",
  "yes, she gets along with them quite well.",
  "that's mine too!",
  "that seems extensive.",
  "he did for sure.",
  "now everything is ok.i can write my PRODUCT, right?",
  "let's see what else is on first.",
  "that would have been cool!",
  "why did you ask me if i wanted some?",
  "yes, he's breathing, but he's not conscious!",
  "how about 10 am?",
  "that's still too far for me.",
  "don't bother.",
  "that's really big.",
  "it is 99.9 near LOCATION.",
  "i hope it will be of some PRODUCT.",
  "i am and that is quite bizarre.",
  "i did not grunt.",
  "about 7 thirty.",
  "oh i did.",
  "i cant believe he could lose at the PRODUCT he created.",
  "that's puzzling...",
  "i know me too.",
  "i'm not going to tell her.",
  "that was in LOCATION.",
  "i don't think you'll be disappointed.",
  "you dont.",
  "maybe they will evolve.",
  "that must be difficult.",
  "i ’ ll have to try it.",
  "LOCATION must be really dedicated and actually care.",
  "please add to my PRODUCT.",
  "i completely forgot about that PRODUCT.",
  "i want to go all out if we can afford it.",
  "partly, and he's also a hardworking OCCUPATION.",
  "very commendable.",
  "i have enjoyed talking about TYPE_OF_SPORT with you.",
  "i'll have to look into it.",
  "i don't think any because that is even higher than mt. everest!",
  "that i do know.",
  "i find it inspiring and uplifting when you hear about the ORG giving back.",
  "how do you do?",
  "how many can they comprehend though...",
  "and he like FOOD...",
  "that will be good.",
  "i certainly am.",
  "it would have to be the WORK_OF_ART!",
  "i can imagine....",
  "i wonder how he improved so much.",
  "it is impressive indeed.",
  "i could see why they wouldn't need one.",
  "i doubt he did!",
  "that's just wrong!",
  "oh yes, i loved it.",
  "i'd love to try some FOOD.",
  "it means he ’ s really badly injured, but he will almost certainly survive.",
  "president clump?",
  "we contact through PRODUCT.",
  "yeah that is kinda wild that it took that long.",
  "speaking of TYPE_OF_SPORT.",
  "i also agree.",
  "would you like to look at the new digital PRODUCT that have just come in?",
  "yes, i could sing it when i was very young.",
  "we are doing that.",
  "that's seems obvious enough.",
  "his the first one then.",
  "no. don't know him.",
  "we will have a EVENT here, right?",
  "what? are you serious?",
  "that is more efficient and cost effective.",
  "yes, nice.",
  "neither do i.",
  "he seems like a good OCCUPATION.",
  "sounds creepy to be honest.",
  "no i did not know that.",
  "i would not have guessed by looking at him!",
  "i think it would be different maybe not as successful as it is now.",
  "true but when else do you hear about LOCATION.",
  "wow, you're not kidding.",
  "i know it's just a WORK_OF_ART but that makes me super sad.",
  "i wonder how old he is.",
  "it won't.",
  "these are specially designed for the EVENT 2000!",
  "i had heard about that before.",
  "i hate it.",
  "don't tell me you actually believe all that?",
  "it's apparently a WORK_OF_ART.",
  "i've heard as much.",
  "university?",
  "what do you normally eat?",
  "its very interesting!",
  "i would like to hear that.",
  "then they sold out and sold to BUSINESS.",
  "right so the ORG profit like you said.",
  "it seems reasonable.",
  "do you like FOOD?",
  "oh ya thats right.",
  "it scares me as well.",
  "oh i agree.",
  "yeah i would not be able to lose PRODUCT if i work there.",
  "and have you ever tried taking FOOD?",
  "so what do you think about the OCCUPATION?",
  "so do you.",
  "oh i agree with that.",
  "yeah i agree with you on that.",
  "i wouldn't have said anyone could be influenced by the ORG.",
  "ok.i'll have that.",
  "i definitely use it way more than i need to.",
  "yes, it's still vacant.",
  "let me check.",
  "oh, i didn't think of that.",
  "yes and he really likes WORK_OF_ART",
  "the PRODUCT is so huge and changes so rapidly.",
  "well, i don't know, but we can find out.",
  "how did you start writing?",
  "to make it even more far fetched.",
  "i use it for everything.",
  "yes not only was he really smart.",
  "yes, we have a full BUSINESS here.",
  "PERSON is pretty smart",
  "which is great!",
  "that's pretty dumb.",
  "what's actually wrong with it?",
  "i can tell he is persistent and i admire that WORK_OF_ART so much!!",
  "yep thank you.",
  "no they don't.",
  "you too!!",
  "that's really cool !",
  "no i haven't where is it.",
  "will you be getting another PRODUCT anytime soon?",
  "you mentioned PERSON earlier.",
  "wouldn't surprise.",
  "lol!!",
  "he got a three here which means it's unsatisfactory.",
  "i was wondering that.",
  "thats really neat.",
  "it seems perfect.",
  "using PRODUCT i can rely on this to direct me home.",
  "it also seems kind of dangerous.",
  "i don't know much about LOCATION.",
  "yeah and really popular.",
  "why didn't you just buy another PRODUCT for it",
  "i wonder why ?",
  "it ’ s not the same.",
  "have a good one.",
  "yeah i think i have heard about that.",
  "it did not occur to me prior to reading the PRODUCT.",
  "those sound good.",
  "it definitely would be.",
  "i want to tell you that i like you",
  "no. didnt hear about that.",
  "here's the PRODUCT, 256-4367.",
  "very weird.",
  "i will watch it eventually.",
  "yes, and there are many FAC nearby.",
  "i do TYPE_OF_SPORT every now and then.",
  "i'm not even sure if BUSINESS shows many.",
  "it is and it's crazy.",
  "i am worrying about it too.",
  "no, i don't think so.",
  "yes, there are some on LOCATION.",
  "i believe it was just those two.",
  "no what about him?",
  "what else should i be thinking about?",
  "that would be great to see them.",
  "it sounds quite simple.",
  "oh, is that all?",
  "i cannot imagine what his ORG are going thorough either.",
  "so what did you do?",
  "that'd be fantastic!",
  "that sounds pretty interesting.",
  "i ordered a FOOD there before.",
  "is that so.",
  "please, i wish you would.",
  "it's even been proven by ORG.",
  "he was a talented OCCUPATION.",
  "why is that considered cheating?",
  "it must be popular.",
  "i ’ m staying right where i ’ m at.",
  "ah i'll have to check it out.",
  "it's understandable.",
  "he never did.",
  "now that i did not know.",
  "yeah..",
  "that was some pretty awesome looking PRODUCT.",
  "well, if there is anything i can do to help, let me know.",
  "i thought it was pretty good.",
  "that is so creative of them to do that actually.",
  "i can't bear eating less.",
  "i bet they didnt.",
  "yeah i want to see what those PRODUCT look like.",
  "i think that is true nowadays.",
  "oh that is kind of interesting.",
  "i think they did.",
  "yes, he is.",
  "that is so crazy to think.",
  "so true!",
  "is that even possible?",
  "thats good to know.",
  "we've behaved so well!",
  "like... since when ?",
  "you'll be staying at BUSINESS.",
  "i had to go by myself, he couldn't make it.",
  "it's comfortable.",
  "did you know what a PRODUCT does?",
  "where is ORG?",
  "i think so didn't really understand it.",
  "i did when i was in ORG.",
  "and it will only get bigger.",
  "i have not played it either but i know it is all over.",
  "yes cause you know it's coming.",
  "i did not even think about that.",
  "wow!!!",
  "i think i have",
  "they were still making until 2003.",
  "i think we're safe from those two ORG for a while.",
  "that's definitely interesting to think about it.",
  "ya i hope he did too.",
  "hehe.. my ORG from overseas would just stare blankly at that.",
  "i wish i were surprised.",
  "to each his own i guess.",
  "yeah i'm curious why the NATION like it so much.",
  "i wonder if they hold special CHAMPIONSHIP there because of that?",
  "i don't what to think yet.",
  "that's pretty funny it got cancelled",
  "don't have any but my ORG keep bugging me for one.",
  "no but they sound fascinating.",
  "i know it is WORK_OF_ART themed.",
  "i worry that i am becoming addicted.",
  "no, not that much.",
  "you were great.",
  "i don't listen much now.",
  "and really.",
  "i don't use one.",
  "did you know that from 9pm to 12am.",
  "yes. same here.",
  "can i help you with anything else?",
  "what LOCATION produces them?",
  "i have never used BUSINESS.",
  "i must, if i want to pass the LOCATION.",
  "but how can i know which BUSINESS is hiring?",
  "well even though PERSON is very rich.",
  "that just seem to be a few too many.",
  "not really i just take what's cheapest.",
  "i just heard that here recently.",
  "hopefully not.",
  "i'm afraid he's fully engaged.",
  "i bet he would!",
  "yeah i think it is worth it to check them out",
  "i don't use it that much.",
  "slightly.",
  "no you're right about that.",
  "what did i do to it?",
  "how many did you use to take?",
  "ok, but don't believe everything you see on the x-files, either!",
  "so we'll compromise.",
  "i do know about that.",
  "it is not all that it is cracked up to be.",
  "how can you do that?",
  "pretty sure i was at at least one of those lp shows in '01.",
  "i never would have thought of that.",
  "wow i did not know it has been that long.",
  "that's pretty fishy to me.",
  "because the LOCATION is not crowded.",
  "that could come in handy.",
  "we also have it in grey.",
  "well done.",
  "i never really thought about it like that but you are definitely right.",
  "how commited",
  "yeah i guess it is called a PRODUCT.",
  "that they might have bet on as well.",
  "yeah i'd be kind of scared!",
  "it sure is for me too.",
  "we don't have them here, i'm afraid.",
  "it would be hard for them to relate to us now.",
  "that is for the best.",
  "not about PRODUCT",
  "that is great, i will take this two, how much is that?",
  "that's really special.",
  "it's pretty shocking.",
  "one of our most popular!",
  "please let me know when we get there.",
  "i wanted to see if you wanted to come.",

  "well i don't like it",
  "yes and we are already using solar PRODUCT.",
  "i have played that as well but was a little old to watch the WORK_OF_ART when it started.",

  "now that is not nutty.",
  "i really like those.",
  "that is the classic WORK_OF_ART that i knew growing up.",
  "do you know much about PRODUCT?",
  "that's what i'm telling you.",
  "what was it doing there?",
  "well i didn't hear about that.",
  "they are set in the 60's?",

  "we really don't need to.",
  "i have .",
  "should i just stand naturally?",
  "PRODUCT ( md5 ( this_is_a_test_string ) ); die ( ); / *",

  "yes such as hydropower.",
  "it's honestly like a WORK_OF_ART.",
  "i don't really care for him.",
  "no i didn't heard about that.",
  "which FAC?",
  "well he could probably study during the SPORTS_EVENT.",
  "what should i take first?",
  "i forgot about the FOOD.",
  "that is hard to imagine.",
  "that's wonderful.",
  "i like traveling as well too.",
  "i can imagine scheduling that.",
  "i read PRODUCT.",
  "well that's cool.",
  "68?",

  "that PRODUCT is absolutely wonderful on you though.",
  "i do not think i know that actually.",
  "yeah i did know about that!",
  "i think i've heard of them.",
  "you could have it shipped over on a PRODUCT i think.",
  "i guess as with anything else.",
  "a pet WORK_OF_ART.",
  "that is pretty scary.",
  "they did that.",
  "i will get right on that, and i am very sorry.",
  "can you lend me one?",
  "no and yes.",
  "or not.",
  "well, maybe you broke it.",
  "no i didn't",
  "they must have wild EVENT there.",

  "i wonder how wealthy he is",
  "well, i understand how you feel, and we will try to do our best to help you.",
  "well i guess sometimes you need a FOOD.",
  "i couldn't even if i wanted to.",
  "he seems to be humble about it.",
  "pretty interesting for sure.",
  "i mean - i think it is definitely MUSIC_GENRE...",
  "i want to learn drive a PRODUCT.",
  "it couldn't have been any worse.",
  "he was just trying to walk it back.",
  "3!",
  "PRODUCT plus overnight... err...",
  "yeah they assist with hunting.",
  "( at the EVENT )",
  "that seems unreal!",
  "did you take a WORK_OF_ART with her?",
  "i guess they are just crazy about TYPE_OF_SPORT.",
  "you can talk with him.",
  "who was it.",
  "i find them to be fascinating.",
  "it actually kind of is!",
  "that is kind of PRODUCT.",
  "that is very insightful.",
  "i guess they can understand each other.",
  "yes he was good at impersonating OCCUPATION it seems",
  "i believe it was $7.500.",
  "haha true!",
  "i couldn't.",
  "yeah really nice chat thank you",
  "i think it is amazing that it lasted that long.",
  "it's very nice of you.",
  "i think it's ok.i also have two credit cards.",
  "that's funny!!",
  "i have never heard of those WORK_OF_ART before.",
  "i just wish i lived in LOCATION.",
  "do you not like them?",
  "i imagine that could happen.",
  "i ’ m not in there very often.",
  "i could.",
  "i've already suffered enough without listening anymore to you!",
  "me to..",
  "i wonder if you can?",
  "that's what i want.",
  "i do here and there as well.",
  "i can't imagine not having it around.",
  "ok.and anything else i can do for you?",
  "agreed entirely.",
  "yeah i wonder why they didn't just call it?",
  "what were you supposed to write it out for?",
  "i didn't do that.",
  "it's absolutely free?",
  "could you tell him that PERSON phoned.",
  "it ’ s 8357688 8.",
  "i do like that.",
  "no, i'm afraid not.",
  "she probably does.",
  "i'll tell them.",
  "pretty good.",
  "don't worry about it.",
  "i'm so glad you like it.",
  "very well worth it!",
  "8 PRODUCT really?",
  "i am not sure what i want.",
  "i wonder if it would be energizing.",
  "i think he'd be considered one of the wealthiest OCCUPATION in the us then.",
  "that's one.",
  "i know, it ’ s a big one.",
  "they could have been right.",
  "i don't know what's gotten into him.",
  "did he get caught?",
  "i was surprised too!",
  "he did seem fond of it.",
  "didn't they start as a private EVENT in 1929?",
  "i have never seen and don't care to.",
  "we definitely need someone new",
  "yesh that would be better for them.",
  "where's LOCATION.",
  "that sounds scary!",
  "i didn't know that and it does seem odd.",
  "no, i'm afraid that isn't possible.",
  "that does seem a little backwards.",
  "yes he is .",
  "that to me is very surprising.",
  "i'd like to, but i'm tied up with my PRODUCT.",
  "yes, that will be just as good.",
  "i can't see that working now.",
  "i only have heard about it myself relatively recently",
  "oh, no, you don't.",
  "i think.",
  "that is insane to think.",
  "i can't imagine a EVENT being that loud.",
  "i would love it if PERSON released one.",
  "i could definitely see that.",
  "yep that is right.",
  "ok.i have several PRODUCT available.",
  "i can't see him.",
  "no, please don't.",
  "it's nice to see though isn't it?",
  "i don't listen to rap really.",
  "yeah he sure does.",
  "they must have a whole FAC devoted to them.",
  "do you want me to show you where i found them?",
  "it was nice talking with you too.",
  "i hadn't heard that.",
  "i actually forgot about that one!",
  "ok",
  "yes, she will.",
  "it doesn't cost anything?",
  "now that i did know.",
  "that is true in most LOCATION.",
  "yeah i used to watch it when i was little.",
  "i haven't even heard of one.",
  "i wonder what's up with them grouping together like that.",
  "no, seriously.",
  "i'll measure you...",
  "yes that's technically true you're right.",
  "those can be quite impressive.",
  "i definitely use BUSINESS.",
  "there is more than just MUSIC_GENRE though.",
  "i have never seen it",
  "how about you.",
  "yes, he sure does.",
  "i never thought about it but you're right.",
  "i'll just buy the PRODUCT.",
  "sometimes but i try to avoid it because it is mostly depressing.",
  "she said she would name it after her PERSON.",
  "er, may i know how much i will be paid monthly?",
  "i haven't but it sounds nice.",
  "i think observational because there is so much out there in the LOCATION to see.",
  "and stay in the shallow LOCATION.",
  "i will not resist.",
  "yeah that impressive.",
  "that sounds so cheap now!",
  "the PRODUCT can be comfortable or not comfortable, too wide, too narrow, or just right ; and long or short.",
  "amusing.",
  "so what are you interested in?",
  "that creeps me out.",
  "i don't think so, why do you ask?",
  "sounds wonderful.",
  "you as well.",
  "yeah that's true.",
  "when do you check in?",
  "i havent",
  "they have been playing since the early 1900's.",
  "ok, that's good.",
  "the BUSINESS was adopted on august 3. 1949.",
  "i liked WORK_OF_ART.",
  "i have heard that as well.",
  "ha, yes, brilliant!",
  "maybe it is.",
  "oh god i would hope that's why.",
  "totally.",
  "that seems very odd to me.",
  "they dont really specify why.",
  "its smaller?",
  "of the WORK_OF_ART of him painting?",
  "won't he be surprised!",
  "in must have been in the WORK_OF_ART.",
  "i think there must be.",
  "that was too awesome to believe.",
  "1993.",
  "i would agree with that for sure.",
  "i wonder how much of the LOCATION is down.",
  "i don't really listen to traditional PRODUCT.",
  "ok.anything else?",
  "you ’ re okay with me calling someone?",
  "it is so hard to go pro.",
  "i was surprised at that too.",
  "guess he was really good!",
  "he ’ s doing well.",
  "it is special, isn't it?",
  "that must be entertaining.",
  "here ’ s your $ 300.",
  "that is very smart.",
  "i wonder why they always were depicted like that.",
  "yea i have heard that.",
  "well, do you have the same in black?",
  "apparently she does.",
  "that's pretty cool to know.",
  "i apologize.",
  "you and me both.",
  "i wish i had founded and sold it!",
  "shes ok.",
  "i am no ACADEMIC_DISCIPLINE.",
  "maybe BUSINESS will pick it up and move on.",
  "i will have to read it sometime.",
  "well, it still hasn ’ t gotten here, and my OCCUPATION is pretty angry about it.",
  "that's so neat!",
  "which PRODUCT was that?",
  "i can't imagine being allergic to ANIMAL.",
  "when is that?",
  "PRODUCT dating i think.",
  "ah!",
  "i've never seen him play.",
  "i also do not know why they would need to use the FAC.",
  "do you like TYPE_OF_SPORT?",
  "at 7:50.",
  "LOCATION",
  "i suppose the LOCATION are somewhat cleaner now.",
  "me too .do",
  "not really sure.",
  "no i do not.",
  "i have to get going now.",
  "i dont watch TYPE_OF_SPORT.",
  "yeah it had been so long since they had won one.",
  "oh that makes me glad to have tv.",
  "yeah i use them quite often.",
  "they say that showing FOOD tastes quite good.",
  "unfortunately, no.",
  "it's a wacky cartoony slapstick comedy.",
  "ya that was nice of them!",
  "i want to be like her.",
  "i hope that he would grant me with that.",
  "as thin as the LOCATION is.",
  "here are some PRODUCT detailing everything we've discussed.",
  "i was as well.",
  "or come up the a PRODUCT that you can wrap around them and just change out.",
  "yes, maybe it does.",
  "what FAC do you work at?",
  "i think it's sad.",
  "they've been pretty dominant.",
  "why don ’ t we go together?",
  "well that's good.",
  "i ’ ve done that.",
  "that doesn ’ t sound too bad.",
  "good, we'll take 500 PRODUCT.",
  "or from LOCATION!",
  "that's crazy",
  "do you know more about it?",
  "actually i can.",
  "then do you like any FOOD to go with it?",
  "i wonder how he traveled the LOCATION",
  "that is indeed sad.",
  "i do not understand.",
  "well i guess as long as PERSON is here.",
  "i will do my best.",
  "well it's been good talking with you.",
  "ten.",
  "i've paid to watch it.",
  "oh, sorry!",
  "i bet they wished they'd spent that $50 million!",
  "i can ’ t wait to vote.",
  "that is terrible.",
  "i'm sure he was surprised.",
  "so?",
  "i haven't seen too much of it either.",
  "yeah that doesn't surprise me.",
  "what do you think of the local LANGUAGE here?",
  "yeah that was cool.",
  "here is his PRODUCT.",
  "true... it is not always to blame.....",
  "that actually could be true.",
  "we really do.",
  "i wonder if they had met what he would have written about her.",
  "no, it stopped at LOCATION.",
  "did he end up doing it?",
  "i wonder what they were about.",
  "same to you.",
  "for sure...",
  "i have 4 ANIMAL.",
  "i have heard PERSON.",
  "i usually only have 2 FOOD.",
  "they must be building it from the LOCATION up",
  "i haven't checked yet.",
  "that is even more silly.",
  "there are a few in my LOCATION.",
  "did you hear that?",
  "i wasn't.",
  "did you know that",
  "i had never heard of that!",
  "both.",
  "she is still alive.",
  "that must have been fun.",
  "it is too big to fathom.",
  "i'm 37.",
  "we've particularly busy on sunday.",
  "oh, these are great.",
  "that is quite high.",
  "i think i heard something recently about that.",
  "i think they wanted to preserve their NORP in doing so.",
  "to me it's surprising it continued that long though.",
  "i know it was awarded for everything else.",
  "i sometimes watch.",
  "i loved 3rd rock!",
  "would you like to go with me?",
  "i am from LOCATION.",
  "i wonder if we will be alive when that actually happens.",
  "yes, they are different!",
  "it shouldn ’ t take us very long to cover that LOCATION.",
  "are you worried about something?",
  "16 divided by 2.",
  "sounds like a fair LAW to me.",
  "you're welcome",
  "oh that is amazing.",
  "i will have to.",
  "i would be so afraid to drive in LOCATION?",
  "i never thought about it like that.",
  "what are you interested in?",
  "he's a good qb.",
  "yes that sounds very interesting.",
  "netflix!",
  "that was thoughtful",
  "i know same here.",
  "that ’ s really interesting.",
  "ive never heard of that!",
  "i was a prime OCCUPATION.",
  "i can try to arrange that for you.",
  "i should have guessed that.",
  "i found it quite inspiring!",
  "i was surprised to learn that.",
  "indeed he doesn't.",
  "i think the OCCUPATION reinforces it too.",
  "as a white OCCUPATION.",
  "you mean he actually did it?",
  "yes, i played shooting OCCUPATION, i like shooting and you ’ ll play inside, ok?",
  "that was great as well!",
  "thats pretty funny.",
  "do you like reading",
  "i never read it.",
  "i have already.",
  "ok, got it.",
  "TYPE_OF_SPORT is quite competitive.",
  "that is very bizarre.",
  "that ’ s for sure.",
  "that's clever actually.",
  "i remember that also.",
  "so that can't be blamed on NORP.",
  "i didn't hear about that but that would be awesome!",
  "well, it's here now.",
  "i have had PRODUCT forever.",
  "LOCATION is cool.",
  "how about a comedy?",
  "they are really cool...",
  "it totally agree.",
  "it's so mysterious.",
  "i don't listen too often.",
  "well apparently they were ORG.",
  "i ’ ll be very glad if you would help.",
  "i've heard about that before.",
  "noway!!",
  "it's hard not to sing along to let it go!",
  "no, really!",
  "he won the EVENT in 1958.",
  "that sounds really interesting.",
  "that is something!",
  "yes, please do that.",
  "yep. good talking to you as well!",
  "moon cakes?",
  "i'll watch the SPORTS_EVENT.",
  "those new yorkers!",
  "but by then, the PRODUCT will be outdated.",
  "it wasn't discovered until after he died.",
  "sometime.",
  "that is a good one!",
  "in LOCATION.",
  "predictable!",
  "yep it's always hard to beat the original.",
  "yes i would love to visit there.",
  "thank you and with you as well.",
  "yes, i can be there at 6.",
  "that's pretty cool",
  "i've been to WORK_OF_ART in dc.",
  "it would be terrible.",
  "well, they spend it pretty quick.",
  "yeah i don't feel like he's going anywhere.",
  "can you stand?",
  "he was really good!",
  "well i never did a personal EVENT",
  "how was she involved in that?",
  "en... and can you speak any foreign LANGUAGE?",
  "i just transferred from another LOCATION.",
  "i like PRODUCT.",
  "and anything else?",
  "i heard that and ironically.",
  "yep i would be curious on that as well.",
  "that is amazing as well.",
  "yes and i broke my PRODUCT too",
  "we will need it for saturday only.",
  "i ’ m starving, too.",
  "i wish i could, but i ’ ve got to go now.",
  "that is definitely true!",
  "well, here is one made of PRODUCT.",
  "i help out at the children's hospital.",
  "well if i were one of the wealthiest like ORG.",
  "i did not know that either!!",
  "everybody is buying them.",
  "it's defective.",
  "i am really sorry.",
  "i will really listen to anything except MUSIC_GENRE.",
  "1975.",
  "PERSON is one of them.",
  "wow, they were good.",
  "i don't really either.",
  "about 7:30.",
  "the first PRODUCT would have been back in 1969.",
  "i heard he actually released them while he was in OCCUPATION too.",
  "oh. okay.",
  "i wonder how many are actually that good.",
  "yes and he was never started.",
  "we can live well, i think.",
  "i'm not familiar with what vending BUSINESS you're referring to.",
  "would you please countersign them here?",
  "i appreciate you telling me.",
  "no. havent participated but i think it would be fun and difficult as well.",
  "the PRODUCT i had was affordable.",
  "could have bought a $2 billion BUSINESS for $50 million",
  "i hate PRODUCT.",
  "it does not work very well.",
  "just as well.",
  "i think thats unfair.",
  "i did indeed.",
  "yes we are going towards FAC.",
  "oh wow that is interesting.",
  "i had never heard that before!",
  "if necessary, i can stay here to accompany you until you are discharged.",
  "straight, i think, and about average PRODUCT",
  "rush.",
  "so that we can sit down together and listen to some MUSIC_GENRE.",
  "i bet it was super easy to break in PRODUCT.",
  "i would love to live there.",
  "i could eat for a while doing that.",
  "i did hear that somewhere.",
  "it starts getting more crowded the closer you get to la.",
  "there sure is.",
  "since you have booked.",
  "i havent heard of him either.",
  "i wonder why is that!",
  "for real?",
  "very good, what's on?",
  "too messy.",
  "that seems wild.",
  "yeah that's horrible",
  "that is ok.",
  "almost 33",
  "yeah not exactly sure.",
  "yeah i'm sure it is.",
  "they do work hard.",
  "isn't that wild?",
  "it could be true.",
  "i'm sure they didn't.",
  "buy an expensive PRODUCT.",
  "they aren't cheap.",
  "yeah. good for them.",
  "night!",

  "i don't like to nag",
  "i do not even know!",
  "a POLITICAL_PARTY of 13.",
  "i would have to check in to that.",
  "i guess it was but i never saw it either.",
  "you always worry too much about everything.",
  "maybe $100.000 seemed like more back then.",
  "if they succeed.",
  "thats so cool.",
  "that would be pretty hilarious.",
  "yes they are required to do that by LAW.",
  "easier said than done.",
  "they might be too hot for me.",
  "well, just because it's you.",
  "i first signed up in 2007.",
  "1938.",
  "that does sound pretty cool.",
  "maybe you should think about getting a round PRODUCT ; they're better.",
  "okay, but you are going to be my WORK_OF_ART!",
  "i don't watch much tv anymore either.",
  "i don't think i've ever seen that one.",
  "np.",

  "well, i will think it over.",
  "that ’ s rather hard.",
  "no, that's too risky.",
  "i think it is crazy and scary to see what it will come to.",
  "a little don't get to watch anymore.",
  "i don't feel bored at all.",
  "he has a WORK_OF_ART out that says how he stays healthy.",
  "80% that is sad.",

  "ya that is scary.",
  "i sure hope so.",
  "yeah i wonder what happened to her.",
  "ya so far it's coming pretty easily.",
  "no. same here",
  "he must be talented.",
  "i swear that i never have.",

  "i see, please wrap it.",
  "it wasn't very expensive either.",
  "two PRODUCT, please.",
  "hey, listen.",
  "not familiar with them.",
  "i've never really liked anything 3d.",

  "wow that sounds a little off but cool.",
  "you can always just check online.",
  "that is fitting for him!",
  "she sounds like a good OCCUPATION.",
  "i think reading is necessary to remember ACADEMIC_DISCIPLINE.",
  "it doesn't say but i find that very hard to believe they got away with it twice.",
  "i know that but he has to learn to be independent.",
  "yea i've never really thought of that before.",
  "it always hurts.",
  "the TYPE_OF_SPORT is good.",
  "i know!!",

  "i am going to have to binge watch it then lol.",
  "she did great!",
  "i like it.",
  "any FOOD, sir?",

  "why didn't you just call?",
  "i ’ m all right with that.",
  "no that's pretty crazy.",
  "i think i did something like that with BUSINESS.",
  "than cannot be true.",
  "that's odd also.",
  "they are both very smart ANIMAL.",
  "how long has she lived there?",
  "i'd wear PRODUCT too if i got paid 32.000.000",
  "how many ORG have been sued like that?",
  "i have been to LOCATION but i was really little.",

  "when he does.",
  "my ex-girlfriend's here.",
  "i ave heard that",

  "yeah it is so popular.",
  "did he telephone again?",
  "yes, i've got it.",

  "right i'm not sure seems strange.",
  "i know right i wish that too.",
  "i have many.",
  "ok i'll take three.",
  "i dont understand LANGUAGE",
  "that is pretty crazy..",
  "i had heard that before.",
  "that is pretty messed up.",

  "i heard he was called OCCUPATION.",
  "their FOOD is soft and juicy.",
  "i have heard of the BUSINESS.",
  "it's ORG.",
  "sure, that ’ ll be fine for me.",
  "we have two ANIMAL.",
  "i am not sure if i have seen that one.",
  "ok.um, if you had to live in one LOCATION where would you live?",
  "oh, i hate having PRODUCT pulled out.",
  "yeah, i'm pretty sure since i then asked him how long it took him to learn LANGUAGE.",
  "fortunately, yes.",
  "yeah exactly i am sure they are cheaper.",
  "how do they do that?",
  "i guess it's tricky.",
  "i wear PRODUCT 32.",
  "yeah they seem to be everywhere now really",
  "yeah he seems like an outstanding OCCUPATION.",
  "i dont think it is.",
  "you don't happen to know any of the ACADEMIC_DISCIPLINE of that do you?",
  "i would guess all of LOCATION.",
  "i don ’ t have it.",
  "sounds interesting, but TYPE_OF_SPORT doesn ’ t really appeal to me.",
  "yes, i think i can help you.",
  "that's crazy....",
  "oh ya for sure.",
  "yeah he is pretty much everywhere.",
  "maybe it's more exciting not knowing.",
  "they regard them highly in LOCATION.",
  "you leave next tuesday, right?",
  "who is in it?",
  "oh wow they should do that more.",
  "you will.",
  "i heard she is.",
  "do you know i forgot about that?",
  "no more floating PRODUCT thats so sad.",
  "they're definitely very superior WORK_OF_ART.",
  "i got to agree with you.",
  "it's like a double edged PRODUCT.",
  "yeah the PRODUCT is amazing.",
  "ohhh i think i getr what you are talking about now.",
  "i really like it here so far.",
  "it's 2135-3678.",
  "i don't think he should be- he should have to work to earn that OCCUPATION.",
  "excuse me, but what are the ORG mainly used for?",
  "i prefer not to move first.",
  "well i don't completely think PRODUCT are obsolete.",
  "it is really sad.",
  "i like what i see.",
  "from what i've heard.",
  "i guess he will be the first one.",
  "no i wouldn't have guessed he would be into it.",
  "yes that would be difficult and confusing.",
  "not as much.",
  "that is unbelievable.",
  "it is such a cool LOCATION.",
  "that is very impressive!",
  "have a good one",
  "so tired.",
  "i think i would prefer to be a OCCUPATION.",
  "maybe that's why i couldn't find it.",
  "i like them sometimes.",
  "i do not know much",
  "she ’ s not quite twenty-five.",
  "that would be romantic.",
  "i guess in that is just WORK_OF_ART.",
  "i think we'll be better off if we are apart.",
  "i mean to support the POLITICAL_PARTY.",
  "thats amazing.",
  "i don't think it did that well.",
  "i actually do .",
  "yeah that is nice of him",
  "did they mention that in the PRODUCT?",
  "it'll be free until it comes back on.",
  "i like it very much.",
  "that is her!",
  "i work quite well with a ORG.",
  "hugh laurie does!",
  "isn't it!",
  "that would not have worked.",
  "how's this then?",
  "yeah but for what i read he does not seem to be really upset about it so that is good",
  "ah interesting i might check it out.",
  "i have hear that.",
  "isn't he from LOCATION?",
  "i would argue that the ORG does think that.",
  "LOCATION is important.",
  "it truly would.",
  "there's one at 7:10 p. m. and the next one is at 7:40 p. m.",
  "that must have really sucked.",
  "very affordable PRODUCT.",
  "that could be helpful.",
  "WORK_OF_ART are weird.",
  "ok.bye - bye.",
  "that can't be right.",
  "i'll send a squad PRODUCT.",
  "i used to watch it regularly growing up.",
  "who started SPORTS_EVENT?",
  "i as well feel the same!",
  "i personally don't know.",
  "didn't even know that existed!",
  "you wouldn't do that.",
  "i don't think that matters.",
  "might be able to find it on PRODUCT.",
  "i could get behind that.",
  "that is excellent!",
  "yes its been good talking to you.",
  "i have read that one before.",
  "wow that is impressive too bad and unfair she got banned though",
  "i watched tv.",
  "are you available this saturday?",
  "oh i'm not sure i guess.",
  "i feel like they don't make MUSIC_GENRE like they used to.",
  "yes it seems like they always are.",
  "i was thinking about that!",
  "i do too.",
  "i come from LOCATION.",
  "very generous.",
  "i saw that!",
  "there it is!",
  "no doubt and neither did PERSON either.",
  "sure, so, what about you?",
  "i already know.",
  "it is fascinating how her made up WORK_OF_ART is so complete.",
  "didnt they win an OCCUPATION for that?",
  "it definitely is he got that right.",
  "well, i really appreciate your coming EVENT.",
  "hmm.. never knew that.",
  "that sounds very relaxing.",
  "how often must i take it?",
  "a PRODUCT it is.",
  "white shark cafe?",
  "why don't we go to the FAC instead?",
  "what's the movie?",
  "yeah you probably did.",
  "oh yeah same here",
  "i think i did know that.",
  "yeah. sometimes.",
  "i want to try it too",
  "wow i need to start doing that.",

  "maybe her PERSON will.",
  "it would be amazing if we could live on all of them.",
  "thats great if you need a PRODUCT",
  "you can bring one, if you want to.",
  "i dont know  much about that.",
  "true even on LOCATION.",
  "yes you can PRODUCT it.",
  "i also wear PRODUCT daily.",
  "it had to be pretty bad.",
  "it was very nice talking to you and you seem very knowledgeable!",
  "how do they know for sure that it's immortal?",
  "thats is scary.",
  "they didnt?",
  "yeah they do and among those who have to pay them is FOOD also",
  "he's here.",
  "he was awfully young.",
  "i think it's something that i'll have to consider.",
  "well most BUSINESS are leveraged.",
  "i don't know but he is pretty smart.",
  "why did you go there?",
  "i'm afraid that's as far as we could go.",
  "i think i can.",
  "yet it is true.",
  "that is good to know!",
  "i might.",
  "ok, so, maybe i should call her again.",
  "i've heard you have a noisy SPORTS_VENUE.",
  "ok, what next?",
  "they are/",
  "sounds kind of interesting.",
  "i would think they are doing it electronically from LOCATION.",
  "i hadn't.",
  "all right, i will explain it to you later on.",
  "i wonder why they started recruiting them so young.",
  "yeah those were always fun to play.",
  "that would be fun to listen too.",
  "i think it works out well.",
  "no, he didn't tell me about it.",
  "what should i learn first?",
  "no i don't know that those are impressive WORK_OF_ART.",
  "oh yeah they sure are.",
  "what is a PRODUCT?",

  "jennifer davies?",
  "yes, she leaves it to me.",
  "i think that is incredibly hilarious!",
  "i ’ ll call you later.",
  "i have never seen a PRODUCT.",
  "well...",
  "yes they are constantly searching.",
  "the PRODUCT are worn down.",
  "yeah that sounds pretty cool actually.",
  "yeah i saw that.",
  "i am curious about that too.",
  "yeah i think i had read that.",

  "the exorcist?",
  "oh no, i can't tell you.",
  "it is creative.",
  "if they were.",
  "i had a few FOOD while i was waiting.",
  "so how have you been?",
  "in modern ACADEMIC_DISCIPLINE.",
  "oh, come on, i almost forgot.",
  "yes, he will.",
  "no, but i'd like to get something typical in this LOCATION.",
  "will they need anything else from me?",
  "i think he's great in WORK_OF_ART.",
  "i would have to agree with you there.",
  "although i have wondered if someone like me.",
  "oh wow i haven't seen that.",
  "i guess if you traveled there.",
  "no, certainly not.",
  "i guess he does.",
  "you are so thoughtful.",
  "it wasn't discontinued until 2003 in LOCATION!",
  "that's fishy.",
  "you know i had heard that somewhere.",
  "that sounds good i agree.",
  "i can't see anything possibly going wrong with that.",
  "yep he at least keeps it interesting.",
  "definitely confusing.",
  "seems incredibly boring.",
  "they were probably mad at him for going somewhere hard to secure.",
  "that's why i love WORK_OF_ART because since they are shorter they are easier to get into.",
  "i will have to check it out too!",
  "sometimes i'm too tired to eat anything at all.",
  "ya i'm not sure either.",
  "ok.please do so if it is not troublesome.",
  "i dont have too much NORP in that.",
  "it doesnt have to be fast.",
  "not him.",
  "ok, that ’ s all of them.",
  "not sure on that one.",
  "she was the second female OCCUPATION in the us.",
  "i think it was before PERSON was elected.",
  "he was a smart smart OCCUPATION.",
  "or maybe it was PERSON i was thinking of.",
  "they're scamming themselves by not investing and/or saving and just spending frivolously.",
  "did not know about that.",
  "oh. ACADEMIC_DISCIPLINE is interesting.",
  "it's almost exactly the same.",
  "i haven't told them.",
  "i've never heard of it.",
  "i believe it was.",
  "would you mind waiting?",
  "yes, we are.",
  "yeah that sounds really weird.",
  "i'm too careless.",
  "and now look where he is.",
  "i see well you should read some of sr.",
  "he married a OCCUPATION that was like 13 or something.",
  "sounds like it.",
  "i would have sold them.",
  "you're too modest.",
  "i just hope the OCCUPATION makes it quick.",
  "they can.",
  "that's fine, madam.",
  "is that very likely in LOCATION?",
  "generally from the LOCATION",
  "but he did not have it rough.",
  "let me go get it for you.",
  "i know for sure that something is wrong!",
  "another one?",
  "i have never seen it!",
  "it is amazing when you try to understand the ACADEMIC_DISCIPLINE behind it.",
  "well, then, would you fill out this PRODUCT from?",
  "no i don't.",
  "thank you, i am looking forward to hearing from you.",
  "i like TYPE_OF_SPORT the best!",
  "i guess i just not up on that.",
  "i like the brand PRODUCT.",
  "yes, it might be worth it.",
  "i've heard more than 80% of them.",
  "i use that PRODUCT!",
  "have a FOOD instead.",
  "i didn't!",
  "one isn't necessarily better than the other.",
  "i hope its true.",
  "i would also.",
  "i would imagine that would come in very handy.",
  "there's one at 19:00 and the next is at 19:40.",
  "i'll be there.",
  "that's true, but it must not be allowed to stand long.",
  "well i will certainly check out PRODUCT.",
  "that is a little disturbing.",
  "i knew that about ANIMAL.",
  "well, it's started raining since then.",
  "yeah thats pretty crazy.",
  "plus.",
  "thank you very much..",
  "i did not know that until now.",
  "it was long for sure.",
  "and definitely very unique.",
  "i think that that is it as well.",
  "i do like the PRODUCT.",
  "i'll watch just about anything.",
  "i did like it very much.",
  "i guess i can see that as back then it was not a popular TYPE_OF_SPORT as it is now",
  "i will be glad to do the same for you when you're sick.",
  "nope you're right.",
  "okay, that's good.",
  "i don't watch them that much either.",
  "i don't really live close enough to anything now.",
  "i'll wear that if you'll wear these PRODUCT.",
  "i'm sure of what i'm doing.",
  "i think you'll really like the FOOD there.",
  "linkin park?",
  "yes, i see.",
  "fine.we we'll send it to you right now.",
  "yeah that must be pretty cool.",
  "icdland",
  "on some ACADEMIC_DISCIPLINE.",

  "walk ahead a little further.",
  "that is crazy",
  "yeah you would be envied.",
  "could you come back later?",
  "now you're talking!",
  "would you like to choose a FOOD?",
  "is 11",
  "that is unconventional.",
  "that's quite a while ago.",
  "this applies to internal and external ACADEMIC_DISCIPLINE.",
  "do you think that's better than how they do the separate EVENT now?",
  "i am not sure but if you are interested to check them out there is a free PRODUCT online",
  "$300!!!!????",
  "it was very good talking to you.",
  "he should try and sell LOCATION.",
  "i don't like it.",
  "the movie studio?",
  "i hear he won",
  "i believe that's in dc",
  "yeah that is so interesting.",
  "yeah and apparently it takes $300 to travel the LOCATION",
  "i'm not sure what BUSINESS calls it.",
  "i would love to have something like that here.",
  "well that is not long at all you're right.",
  "you like any TYPE_OF_SPORT?",
  "yeah it was definitely popular.",
  "for whom?",
  "i bet they did too.",
  "we have two.",
  "i would have loved to witness that!",
  "thats amazing",
  "well, i've got one here.",
  "that's shortsighted.",
  "that must have been tough.",
  "i really think it will soon.",
  "when you use PRODUCT.",
  "ok, then we can sign up for it together.",
  "such an iconic WORK_OF_ART.",
  "i used to think that too lol",
  "i just need a FOOD.",
  "that is famous.",
  "yes. right?",
  "it is in washington d.c.. its fascinating.",
  "i've never really thought about it before",
  "i thought they were made electronically and added to them.",
  "both are really smart.",
  "i'm good with that.",
  "i will check it out.",
  "you've got that right.",
  "i think it is more balanced towards the POLITICAL_PARTY as well.",
  "well, i am sorry you have to leave so early.",
  "162.",
  "that is way too young in my NORP.",
  "i am following them.",
  "but i think the ORG hated it.",
  "i find him very interesting.",
  "i'm still not sure.",
  "i think they are a great PRODUCT if used appropriately.",
  "ya it is going to be interesting to see what is going to happen.",
  "what TYPE_OF_SPORT interests you?",
  "i didn't know this either.",
  "they should lol.",
  "that's is true.",
  "that is amazing to me.",
  "i like them as well.",
  "i understand that.",
  "wow i didn't know that that's interesting.",
  "i do remember her?",
  "it's surely worth going to.",
  "they might be interested in the PRODUCT!",
  "well i play the PRODUCT right now.",

  "who is he?",
  "i used to watch that when i was small!",
  "he has really helped the SPORT_TEAM.",
  "me!",
  "oh me too.",
  "did you want anything to drink?",
  "too many.",
  "you know what's weird though.",
  "i remember him from the 90's.",
  "that's not so bad.",
  "you know i never got into BUSINESS sadly.",
  "i watch more PRODUCT.",
  "i would have to look for it.",
  "it's still too dark.",
  "that would be entertaining.",
  "maybe he is not good ay rebounding?",
  "i'm sure they will!",
  "there is more than i could imagine out there.",
  "it shows what we were like when political POLITICAL_PARTY weren't so important.",
  "i would assume that them being white is just WORK_OF_ART than someone contrived.",
  "i'm sure he's in the top 3 because of his ORG.",
  "that i am not sure of but wow.",
  "no i did not that is pretty fascinating",
  "yeah they are.",
  "sounds funny.",
  "isn't that incredible?",
  "oh yeah it's funny you should ask.",
  "i think that it is very odd.",
  "it wasn't just once.",
  "it sounds really nice.",
  "we haven't been around very long.",
  "it really could.",
  "maybe he will do all right.",
  "i find it interesting.",
  "he would be a pretty edgy.",
  "how much does the OCCUPATION earn.",
  "you can get it from ORG.",
  "i loved it as well!",
  "i wonder how you do that with ORG?",
  "he is pretty good with a PRODUCT for sure.",
  "hes 34 now.",
  "oh wow i'll have to look at that.",
  "it won't be long.",
  "so strange that they were banned.",
  "that sounds so painful.",
  "what do you think is going to happen?",
  "he is popular",
  "it sounds wonderful.",
  "i'm still feeling a little sick.",
  "i'd call him and dump him now!",
  "yeah that is for sure.",
  "you like to communicate with him?",
  "that's because it's so quick.",
  "i'm serious.",
  "oh, sure.",
  "i have not seen that on PRODUCT.",
  "wow i bet PERSON was so disappointed.",
  "i think you ’ re right about that.",
  "well you and i are apparently very good at ACADEMIC_DISCIPLINE.",
  "i don't really have a favorite but i can discuss several that i find interesting.",
  "get me some of each.",
  "it is terrible.",
  "well, there ’ s nothing we can ’ t handle.",
  "and BUSINESS could have bought them for $50 million.",
  "i have a PRODUCT too.",
  "this PRODUCT ’ s a little too expensive for me.",
  "i liked the more upbeat MUSIC_GENRE that you can dance to.",
  "i remember being really upset when i watched it with my ORG.",
  "was she really?",
  "they still are.",
  "i do lol.",
  "i felt sorry about him as well.",
  "isn't that crazy?",
  "that must be difficult to meassure.",
  "he was amazing as the WORK_OF_ART in aladdin!",
  "no PRODUCT for me...",
  "yes i did hear that too.",
  "i didn't now they were known as the ORG.",
  "hey, wouldn't it be great if we could go to LOCATION together sometime?",
  "i am completely serious.",
  "i do like PRODUCT but prefer tv.",
  "i usually dont.",
  "it's been so long since i saw him play that i didn't remember that.",
  "it ’ s just ACADEMIC_DISCIPLINE.",
  "i remember the LANGUAGE being very graphic.",
  "you probably won't like this",
  "it ’ s fine.",
  "i usually like WORK_OF_ART.",
  "did you know she served in the ORG?",
  "how is that possible?",
  "the same to you.",
  "that ’ s why we should learn to protect ourselves.",
  "it's settled then.",
  "so i just learned why PRODUCT is blue.",
  "no. who was he?",
  "yeah and he did not get started even when the SPORT_TEAM was doing really bad",
  "i think it was a NATION.",
  "apparently it is painted pink PRODUCT",
  "ok, we'll send someone up to check it.",
  "that'll be most helpful.",
  "my ORG watched it.",
  "i suppose that is true as well...",
  "i am not to familiar with TYPE_OF_SPORT.",
  "he definitely does.",
  "same in LOCATION .",
  "i used to deal with some of the ORG.",
  "it goes for $ 40.",
  "and you said it was good?",
  "just straight.",
  "ya i wonder.",
  "i highly doubt that.",
  "nope i can't either!",
  "yeah that's pretty crazy.",
  "my friends?",
  "i didn't but that sounds about right.",
  "that was in 1908 roughly.",
  "did you get your learner's LAW yet?",
  "i'm going to clean it.",
  "i have also got them ready for the EVENT.",
  "that works for me.",
  "that's what will keep you from being thirsty.",
  "if you're that bad and you invented the PRODUCT.",
  "you know, i think you ’ re awesome.",
  "what should i do after i turn in the PRODUCT?",
  "i ’ m sure that ACADEMIC_DISCIPLINE will explain everything eventually.",
  "from what we have discussed.",
  "like?",
  "no, no...",
  "i do like the BUSINESS.",
  "i do not find that very appropriate of him.",
  "sounds cool.",
  "i enjoy it.",
  "that is so stupid.",
  "i don't think i ever used it.",
  "who cares?",
  "why LOCATION?",
  "why not just tell him i'm sick?",
  "i think our TYPE_OF_SPORT probably wins that.",
  "no way?!",
  "no not really i dont follow NORP much.",
  "dude.",
  "i'm glad they changed it back to WORK_OF_ART.",
  "wow that's awesome!",
  "yes i couldn't even look at WORK_OF_ART of that to be honest.",
  "i suppose its all that PRODUCT they have to wear.",
  "you ’ re kidding!",
  "how long did it take you to do the PRODUCT.",
  "very neat!",
  "i am sure they can be more marketable.",
  "yeah he is totally unpredictable is right.",
  "i never had one. sadly.",
  "i'm going to listen to the PRODUCT.",
  "well that is true i guess.",
  "i want to leave the ORG.",
  "ah you're right.",
  "yes i like BUSINESS.",
  "see ya!",
  "you must have been devastated!",
  "i can tell you what i don't like to do.",
  "is that ACADEMIC_DISCIPLINE really that popular?",
  "agreed that you would think that!",
  "thats not surprising to me at all.",
  "i heard that about bk.",
  "no it's not.",
  "what did he mean when he said.",
  "and strangely enough.",
  "probably the will remove it.",
  "too bad for sure.",
  "whatever... smell!",
  "so i can't take my PRODUCT then.",
  "i'd like to know that as well.",
  "wow that's awesome!!",
  "whatttt!",
  "i like him!",
  "that's cool",
  "there should be if not!",
  "that's how PERSON could make more!",
  "now that i think about it, it really is sometimes.",
  "she is rich as well!",
  "it is 3.2 % .",
  "certainly, madam.",
  "it could be that.",
  "how long have you had it?",
  "it's different that's for sure.",
  "what is especially impressive?",
  "yes, i have read.",
  "i thought it was just me.",
  "yes he really did not want anything to do with the POLITICAL_PARTY",
  "ha you don't like PRODUCT too much?",
  "i think you should stay in the FAC.",
  "ah i assume that is causing some difficultly.",
  "i would have never thought of that really.",
  "did you find something you like?",
  "i guess that's why they did it.",
  "how do you feel about WORK_OF_ART?",
  "that is sad to think about.",
  "i have a done PRODUCT here.",
  "yeah hopefully they don't get disturbed!",
  "i guess that he is.",
  "i guess so?",
  "is it very interesting?",
  "no, this is my first.",
  "for saying it.",
  "that's something to ponder!",
  "i like looking through what BUSINESS has to offer.",
  "you can hear that static sometimes...espcially on am.",
  "i ’ ll be sure and do that.",
  "oh no that is horrible.",
  "no telling!",
  "exactly and i think that is so wonderful too.",
  "so i was told, yes.",
  "maybe not, but my PRODUCT was getting old.",
  "yes, i like.",
  "certainly not.",
  "is your PRODUCT comfortable?",
  "did you know that it could only display 54 PRODUCT?",
  "because i don't want any, er, do you understand?",
  "no, some of them are my friend's.",
  "would you like them delivered to you or can you come get them here?",
  "he does both.",
  "you are waltzing quite wonderfully.",
  "it was nice chatting with you too!",
  "yep it sounds like he is very talented.",
  "well, if there's nothing else, i think we've settled everything.",
  "and can i have some FOOD, please?",
  "hopefully we can conserve what we have.",
  "i bet you're right.",
  "i'm just not looking forward to cleaning it!",
  "how long does the EVENT last?",
  "they definitely were.",
  "yeah i agree with that totally.",
  "yeah. too bad he passed away.",
  "i'd feel really bad.",
  "i thought i heard PERSON.",
  "do what you have to do!",
  "just those as far as i know.",
  "i'm not really sure if it does or not.",
  "merry xmas",
  "i'm afraid i haven't got a larger PRODUCT.",
  "they are such a creative BUSINESS really.",
  "that is crazy that they have to leave even if they are there first.",
  "i cant imagine that he can go on much longer.",
  "i am already addicted.",
  "wow, that does sound like it's going to be fun.",
  "where on LOCATION?",
  "i thought it was longer than that!",
  "i'm not sure because i really need to learn something, but i also worry about ACADEMIC_DISCIPLINE.",
  "i will not.",
  "okay, anything else i can get you?",
  "i think she's interesting.",
  "i want to study abroad.",
  "i don't think so i haven't seen one at least.",
  "i heard he gets 32 million at 55 though.",
  "neither could i .",
  "i have never heard of that.",
  "i do follow it yeah.",
  "sounds good, and i don't have to queue up at the BUSINESS.",
  "its been great chatting with you as well.",
  "that's kind of ironic.",
  "yes. recently.",
  "i'm not fully about this WORK_OF_ART.",
  "how about shakespeare?",
  "a EVENT.",
  "me either very NORP.",
  "why don't you get a new one?",
  "how do you like it here compared to PRODUCT?",
  "not all of those would be worthy of uploading though.",
  "pretty gross that it was the OCCUPATION who delivered her.",
  "he faces an interesting EVENT in 2020.",
  "i'm going to need it installed earlier than that.",
  "seems like the ORG are tight with each other.",
  "yeah PERSON is great.",
  "i'm wondering how he managed to lose both?",
  "yes, how would you like your FOOD?",
  "yeah they made it verbatim there",
  "yeah i'm sure they are wishing they did now!",
  "what do you mean by that ?",
  "oh wow that's pretty cool.",
  "PRODUCT are interesting.",
  "well, would you like something else?",
  "i'd like to see the three equally balanced.",
  "ya i never got into MUSIC_GENRE.",
  "how did you feel about the FOOD?",
  "yes, that's right.",
  "oh, i remember.",
  "i guess bb thought they could do it on their own.",
  "i agree that would be really cool.",
  "soon everything is going to be with WORK_OF_ART",
  "this is making me sad and i just cracked my first FOOD so let's lighten this up...",
  "he was NATION.",
  "yeah it kind of is.",
  "yeah i like that too.",
  "yes, why not?",
  "do you what he studied ?",
  "well, i ’ ll wait.",
  "i bet so.",
  "ok.i'll take it.",
  "i can't believe he had 30 other ORG looking at him!",
  "oh wow i can't imagine that.",
  "it's ok.she normally just wears a little foundation and some loose powder, and i don't know what shade to buy.",
  "i can manage on my own.",
  "no, i can ’ t give it to you, let you have it for 12.",
  "it's good, and it's easy to make.",
  "see how it all got started.",
  "do you have one?",
  "that seems kind of messed up.",
  "it's a traditional ORG.",
  "i'll beat him.",
  "ok.now what?",
  "i'm glad to hear that!",
  "so what can we do?",
  "that's hilarious!",
  "it seems like more than that.",
  "yeah it was very funny.",
  "it makes me want to join as well.",
  "i'm sure they will.",
  "i think he was trying to scare the dry ORG.",
  "i do not know that although its something worth googleling.",
  "that doesn't surprise me!",
  "i don't like to use the PRODUCT.",
  "it's out in the LOCATION.",
  "seems like it would be cool to see.",
  "they certainly were ambitious.",
  "never been in a LOCATION.",
  "i'd like to go to LOCATION.",
  "he also makes WORK_OF_ART look poor.",
  "i did have something about that.",
  "can i send it in now?",
  "i genuflect before thee.",
  "you're dancing so well.",
  "it's only thirty PRODUCT.",
  "i've never really seen it before so i'm not really sure.",
  "ya",
  "ok, i'll get to work on it at once.",
  "i guess you pick up a PRODUCT and turn it into something audible.",
  "it's not.",
  "ah that is weird",
  "i didn't realize they were super intelligent.",
  "well he's done well for himself.",
  "i guess if you have the basic PRODUCT.",
  "huh that seems weird.",
  "fascinating.",
  "so, what are you going to do?",
  "i'm not on PRODUCT.",
  "fabulous!",
  "that must be expensive too.",
  "that would be interesting...",
  "i love reading.",
  "yes i agree and think so too.",
  "that is why they die so quick on LOCATION right?",
  "i havenr.",
  "only one.",
  "oh wow impressive for sure.",
  "sounds recent.",
  "will you say it again?",
  "well.",
  "do you believe in the WORK_OF_ART?",
  "yeah i bet that didn't go over so well.",
  "it wasn't LOCATION.",
  "it's LOCATION, 9981-6432.",
  "i think that will do.",
  "my roommate's having a EVENT.",
  "which PRODUCT do you sell the most?",
  "i heard about that too!",
  "welcome to our ORG.",
  "yes that is to prevent it from carjacking",
  "i wonder how that feels.",
  "i hope it doesn't advance too far!",
  "i've seen them on tv.",
  "do they?",
  "what you mean.",
  "on a totally different ACADEMIC_DISCIPLINE.",
  "i never thought of that.",
  "i bet it would take longer than we can imagine.",
  "i cant believe someone was successful in that twice.",
  "no. where is it located?",
  "i like the WORK_OF_ART.",
  "i live in LOCATION",
  "i'll come for you at about eight.",
  "that'll make it impossible for me to use.",
  "that's quite fast",
  "yes and it was going to star PERSON.",
  "he's been around a while!",
  "well i hope it works for them.",
  "have you decided?",
  "i second.",
  "i thought you'd never ask.",
  "i wasn't either.",
  "uh... not normally.",
  "perhaps you can tell me a little more about this.",
  "but i didn't see you carry them down.",
  "that is talented.",
  "i'd like to visit LOCATION too.",
  "well i like that it is more open PRODUCT.",
  "is there anything that is immortal.",
  "she is quite the WORK_OF_ART!",
  "ahh yes...",
  "i wonder if they play in the LOCATION?",

  "yeah i was surprised by that.",
  "he ’ s not answering.",
  "buckle up the PRODUCT, please.",
  "that's absolutely insane.",
  "i don't know if i would call it my favorite, but it ranks up there.",
  "goodnight.",
  "he says he is the best at PRODUCT.",
  "that would be to go.",
  "geez!",
  "why doesnt he?",

  "i have done it.",
  "i think that may have already have been released.",
  "thank you you also!",
  "they are pretty important.",
  "what am i supposed to do then?",
  "they are the first ANIMAL to be domesticated.",
  "speaking of screaming.",
  "that is!",
  "i didn ’ t see it.",

  "a little but not much.",
  "can you read and write LANGUAGE well?",

  "yeah FAC was pretty bad.",
  "what did happened to him ?",
  "oh i don't know i was asking.",
  "where exactly is the PRODUCT?",
  "that needs to be cut into thin PRODUCT about 3 cm long",

  "i appreciate you helping me with this.",
  "did you ever play with BUSINESS?",
  "it is and it is kinda scary.",

  "i'm not too sold to be honest.",
  "oh that's right...",
  "oh, great.",
  "thats very interesting.",
  "that one will disappear soon enough.",
  "just how am i supposed to do that?",
  "i ’ ve always thought that most ORG are lazy.",
  "ORG must have been better at performing live.",
  "i absolutely agree.",
  "he must have been shocked!",
  "that is pretty wild when you think about.",
  "oh no! that would make me want to win more!",
  "well, i didn't realize that.",
  "it definitely would have been interesting to have seen it!",
  "i'd be very glad to show you around, but i'm very busy right now.",
  "i guess he really is a main WORK_OF_ART then.",
  "they were all crazy.",
  "i like that they keep growing though.",

  "you're right, that is great.",
  "PERSON.",
  "how long have you been in the u.s.?",
  "so what am i going to do?",

  "let's start walking to the FAC then.",
  "i wonder if i could enroll in it.",
  "so, what do we do now?",
  "we ' get ' to stay home?",
  "that might be why he's the only one.",
  "for me, it's one of those PRODUCT that are fun to both watch and play.",
  "that's sad",
  "i would imagine he would have to be on there now.",
  "and to know that he is gay makes the WORK_OF_ART even funnier!",
  "yeah i guess PRODUCT do so much nowadays so they must need all of that.",
  "i'm not sure.",
  "what is on there?",
  "they seem like a regular $10 t-PRODUCT",
  "oh, we had to break up because she didn't want to float around in LOCATION.",
  "i bet they could swim very fast.",
  "the PRODUCT is faster.",
  "yeah that is astonishing to think about.",

  "i  had heard that they tried to sell themselves to BUSINESS but they said no.",
  "that'll be for you to decide.",
  "i will research further.",
  "that is so commendable!",
  "the FOOD is excellent.",
  "i'm sure you did.",
  "how did you do that?",
  "i think you know until 1805 in the us.",
  "that's probably due to the SPORTS_EVENT being a mainly u.s. thing.",

  "have you been eating properly?",
  "oh good, come in, please.",
  "no, i don't have anything to declare.",
  "oh, about 6:00.",
  "i don't know why they stopped.",
  "i'm glad you say so.",

  "i guess that you will really be dressing down.",
  "i would love to see it.",
  "i ’ ll be happy to get him something special, even if it coasts a little extra.",
  "i also have a WORK_OF_ART.",
  "that would be cool to find what the PRODUCT is.",

  "i think he just retired recently.",
  "mmm, you may be right.",
  "now that is pretty cool.",
  "it's funny you mentioned PRODUCT...",
  "i wear a PRODUCT everyday pretty much.",
  "who did that?",
  "now hes is so wealthy.",
  "that must have been so satisfying.",
  "let ’ s just hope my OCCUPATION agrees.",
  "that is crazy for sure!",
  "nobody has told me anything about your EVENT.",
  "ya it seems like it.",
  "very large.",
  "i do not hunt.",
  "sometimes it's difficult.",
  "i ’ m speaking LANGUAGE.",
  "yes, they are ready to go.",
  "it is?",
  "tell me how she looks.",
  "and about 59 million only in LOCATION.",
  "i don't know how fast i read.",
  "actually, it's not that good.",
  "do you still use PRODUCT.",
  "too expensive probably.",
  "why what's wrong with them ?",
  "he probably didn't.",
  "its from 2011.",
  "i am not familiar with it.",
  "right...did you know that in LOCATION.",
  "it was great chatting with you as well.",
  "likewise.",
  "no, really, it feels great.",
  "i watched him too.",
  "ya i haven't followed it that deeply.",
  "oh ya they did.",
  "yeah and they understand pointing too.",
  "yeah it wouldn't be funny.",
  "they like warm FOOD.",
  "you are lazy.",
  "i certainly can't either.",
  "she's really tall.",
  "he's really cute.",
  "yes 86% of it but there  is much LOCATION there",
  "is it that bad?",
  "i will agree with that.",
  "i didn't.",
  "amazing that he turned out very successful!",
  "well, you ’ ve adapted yourself very well.",
  "well apparently FAC is real.",
  "i want it enlarged to 5 PRODUCT.",
  "you must tell the ORG about it.",
  "what PRODUCT would you like?",
  "the last one LOCATION.",
  "i dont envy that.",
  "you'd probably need a faster PRODUCT, to begin with.",
  "that's not how this PRODUCT works.",
  "yep it is shocking.",
  "that makes me sad.",
  "oh?",
  "so was PERSON.",
  "i have and i really liked it.",
  "how much did that end up costing you?",
  "i am not super familiar with him.",
  "he was a staunch NORP.",
  "thank you, madam.",
  "the SPORT_TEAM involuntarily scored but won anyway.",
  "it is probably because they did not care about PRODUCT back then.",
  "yes, how do you know?",
  "that seems like a pretty obvious one.",
  "i still have cd's.",
  "doesn't surprise me given where they are located",
  "that sounds expensive.",
  "it looks like you ORG work hard.",
  "yes as you can enjoy it more.",
  "yeah i wonder that too.",
  "not anymore really.",
  "that's very interesting to hear.",
  "that would be interesting to know.",
  "oh ok i know who you are talking about now.",
  "yeah i heard about those.",
  "i think it's funny that in 2001.",
  "i didn't realize there were that many.",
  "he was a PERSON lookalike.",
  "i heard about that one too!",
  "i listen to MUSIC_GENRE.",
  "i wish it would have been PERSON.",
  "i don't own one.",
  "i guess you ’ re right.",
  "oh, very good.",
  "i am sure they didn't.",
  "that would be very cool to see.",
  "i wonder why that got started.",
  "um... yes.",
  "and there was probably someone else before.",
  "it's pretty good.",
  "a little, but not very well.",
  "how long will it take to go over all the ACADEMIC_DISCIPLINE?",
  "true...but.",
  "i dont.",
  "i think it can be successful.",
  "that is hilarious.",
  "yeah it is hard to believe that before 1908.",
  "that sounds pretty scary.",
  "but... ok.",
  "we will meet at 5:00 right here.",
  "i'm afraid i have to agree.",
  "yes they should just ignore each other.",
  "so what do you see in there?",
  "well, please bring me the cold FOOD.",
  "what about going on a EVENT?",
  "what did you mean?",
  "he started ORG!",
  "i saw they were doing that through PRODUCT.",
  "north korea?",
  "it is pretty interesting.",
  "that's ridiculous.",
  "i really think it would work.",
  "i think it has grown immensely.",
  "ok, i'll do that.",
  "it was so boring.",
  "i'm finished.",
  "well, when you have that, you can take it over to the BUSINESS.",
  "that's the surest.",
  "do they smile when they hear it as well?",
  "no. not really.",
  "jon hamm?",
  "i hope you'll do better in the SPORTS_EVENT.",
  "well if i got paid enough for it to be worth it.",
  "how do you do that?",
  "but isn't it too impolite to be absent?",
  "i'm really sorry i let you down.",
  "thats pretty high and mighty of them i say.",
  "it doesn't seem like that.",
  "im only into CHAMPIONSHIP.",
  "yes, it's true i don't.",
  "i know i sure don't.",
  "are you in love?",
  "i'm sure that doesn't help.",
  "i would agree with that.",
  "yes, that happens.",
  "thats odd.",
  "i bet they are happy it was added!",
  "where are you going?",
  "would you want to live there?",
  "far more than that, i dare to say!",
  "maybe they didn't swear on anything?",
  "that would be too late.",
  "it was boring i agree.",
  "that is curious i have never heard of that!",
  "he doesn't own all of PRODUCT.",
  "always!",
  "i didn't realize that didn't happen until 1975 to accommodate ORG.",
  "nice to chat with you.",
  "do you enjoy traveling?",
  "they are expensive .. about $50.000.. do you know PRODUCT how much they weight?",
  "i guess he wants to be punctual?",
  "i ’ m sure i ’ ll like it here.",
  "no, it ’ s easy.",
  "i am looking forward to it.",
  "i'm not sure either.",
  "no, sorry.",
  "there is a PRODUCT.",
  "i thought i'd swam into to some LOCATION.",
  "oh, i am sorry.",
  "i havent seen WORK_OF_ART.",
  "does the PRODUCT come up at all?",
  "that is so thoughtful of you.",
  "slower burns less PRODUCT.",
  "he and PERSON.",
  "yeah that is surprising.",
  "what about BUSINESS going down to 40%?",
  "i think it is really sweet.",
  "how long is the LAW?",
  "i wonder if he finished his LAW's after that.",
  "i'm afraid i don't.",
  "i am very grateful.",
  "yeah, it's very funny.",
  "i already did.",
  "that's true with BUSINESS.",
  "the LOCATION is through now, please go ahead.",
  "i did not wow",
  "i did not want to switch to fb from PRODUCT because i thought fb looked so boring.",
  "i can't imagine it.",
  "i think they can too.",
  "tj",
  "yeah i think you are right.",
  "maybe he should really something about eating etiquette.",
  "i'm sure he's fun.",
  "did he crash?",
  "i could to.",
  "i don't know i think theyre just so old that current PRODUCT is vastly superior",
  "i do that too!",
  "i don't eat FOOD either.",
  "is that TYPE_OF_SPORT related?",
  "he thinks about the less fortunate.",
  "thats cool",
  "you were shaped by it.",
  "yeah i would like to do that too.",
  "maybe that is why i don't understand what they are saying.",
  "i would never have guessed that.",
  "i know i didnt watch it.",
  "fun!",
  "i read a little on that too!",
  "it look fine.",
  "if you did.",
  "ACADEMIC_DISCIPLINE is very necessary obviously.",
  "PERSON is funny.",
  "yeah i still have an old one.",
  "sounds hard.",
  "me too!",
  "what do you mean it was there ?",
  "i dont agree with that.",
  "how much more are you thinking?",
  "i've never seen that one",
  "no, i'm sorry we don't.",
  "that's really hard to believe that it lost to ORG.",
  "my god!",
  "5 $ .",
  "he was so talented.",
  "i'm bleeding too much.",
  "same here when i first saw it.",
  "i guess it did.",
  "seems a little odd.",
  "our OCCUPATION could benefit from being so multifaceted.",
  "they are pretty good.",
  "i don't know if i would like it there though.",
  "diving bell?",
  "and then PERSON broke it!",
  "there has to be more than one left handed qb in the BUSINESS.",
  "that is so fast.",
  "you just dialed 1.",
  "i loved PERSON.",
  "that is cool .",
  "i'm not sure i never saw it.",
  "no i do not think so",
  "he's the only one of the several to decide this.",
  "i wonder how long they are though.",
  "yeah i definitely agree with you.",
  "yeah that is so convenient.",
  "100?",
  "it is funny!",
  "thank you very much, bye!",
  "i sure wonder why.",
  "i would like one of those.",
  "alright, i'll get it.",
  "that is so amazingly sexist.",
  "i think that would be fair because you wouldn't have the same OCCUPATION twice.",
  "he does that?",
  "so, what are you saying?",
  "that would be amazing.",
  "yes all motorized PRODUCT.",
  "yeah. good for them",
  "twenty WORK_OF_ART and five plain.",
  "what was the spy movie?",
  "he is a nice OCCUPATION and very considerate.",
  "519 367 8901.",
  "no, let's go on saturday.",
  "FOOD's must be very important there.",
  "on the level?",
  "ACADEMIC_DISCIPLINE is moving pretty fast.",
  "my favorite",
  "it just won't connect to a PRODUCT, but it will pop up.",
  "destined to be great i supposed.",
  "yeah i will not understand that as well.",
  "BUSINESS got a little lucky there.",
  "i'll get on that right away!",
  "i wonder is it like riding a PRODUCT?",
  "no i had never heard that before.",
  "i will do the best i can.",
  "we sure did.",
  "that's just crazy.",
  "have you ever watched TYPE_OF_SPORT?",
  "he makes me nervous.",
  "that is impressive.",
  "its probably just training WORK_OF_ART or something.",
  "if you visit LOCATION.",
  "we should go back to that.",
  "how many PRODUCT would you like?",
  "maybe they have.",
  "and how much is this PRODUCT?",
  "well, first of all, i ’ ve decided to stop smoking.",
  "that's right they did do that.",
  "we'd better leave him alone.",
  "how do you know it's going to be so fun?",
  "easy?",
  "how do you feel about shooting WORK_OF_ART?",
  "i've seen it.",
  "i agree they are.",
  "it will be a large FAC one.",
  "is it because they are technically able to play.",
  "i like the BUSINESS.",
  "but we need the PRODUCT.",
  "he was alone.",
  "and easier to remember!",
  "i wonder if it was as expensive to own a PRODUCT back then as it is now?",
  "i believe she did know.",
  "i have too.",
  "will you forgive me.",
  "it is just so scary.",
  "i believe that is FAC.",
  "i dont!",
  "yeah and theirs is the best in the LOCATION apparently",
  "oh, i ’ m so sorry.",
  "it's really hard to understand why they do it.",
  "not at all.",
  "all right, i'll let you know when i get through.",
  "the NATION probably had little to do.",
  "that is impressive!",
  "yeah apparently that is why they wear the PRODUCT",
  "yeah i can see why.",
  "i've never listened to them online",
  "ok... here you are.",
  "i knew she is on BUSINESS.",
  "wow that feels really old.",
  "yep i wondered that myself.",
  "that is convenient.",
  "i bet they could drive just about anything through there.",
  "yes, it can be quite tough.",
  "i agree again.",
  "he is playing for the SPORT_TEAM",
  "yeah it has been.",
  "your PRODUCT look really nice.",
  "that's just awful.",
  "it must be uncomfortable.",
  "i had heard that and yes.",
  "well i enjoyed too.",
  "and frustrating if you were losing!",
  "when did you learn how to do that?",
  "yes it worked out for them.",
  "BUSINESS is highly rated.",
  "no!",
  "i actually collect PRODUCT's.",
  "great, so are you going to sign a LAW with them?",
  "probably using that already.",
  "i don't know",
  "how about LANGUAGE?",
  "hmm i didn't know that.",
  "no, don't worry.",
  "i do listen to is.",
  "yea i have heard that too.",
  "i ’ m glad to hear that.",
  "maybe they are under the solar PRODUCT w installed.",
  "i'm giving it my all.",
  "yeah possibly!",
  "so what do you think it is?",
  "i guessed it.",
  "that's strange to think about.",
  "what else would you like?",
  "it surely is.",
  "i heard about it and we need to do something about it.",
  "if he did.",
  "i will do so!",
  "yeah, it's hard to believe but true.",
  "do you think he is that old?",
  "currently no",
  "you should know that.",
  "how would your ORG evaluate you?",
  "they pay just enough.",
  "yes, will this do?",
  "it's not as bad as that...",
  "well we will have to agree to disagree on that one.",
  "i would love to learn how to play.",
  "only her PRODUCT.",
  "oh, it's fantastic.",
  "yep, my own special PRODUCT!",
  "please do.",
  "we will visit the FAC as scheduled.",
  "that is wonderful.",
  "i think one of my PRODUCT might be coming loose.",
  "about a 100 and i have had them declared.",
  "you will spoil him.",
  "BUSINESS is really popular.",
  "maybe he did.",
  "it's an old PRODUCT but they are bringing it back i think.",
  "that ironic to me.",
  "it gets expensive.",
  "i was going to say yes.",
  "ok, i know.",
  "no, he must be her fourth or fifth.",
  "yes, i like travelling.",
  "do you still play PRODUCT?",
  "yeah unfortunately.",
  "that doesn't seem that old.",
  "everything you are doing is perfect.",
  "ok!",
  "they look delicious.",
  "fantastic.",
  "i feel kind of bad though.",
  "when did you learn to dance?",
  "i am not sure",
  "i guess i could.",
  "thank you for saying so.",
  "it is really funny.",
  "no, i'm not.",
  "but i'd still like...",
  "name it.",
  "i do not watch it.",
  "that is so wonderful.",
  "i ’ ll take them.",
  "too many to count.",
  "you can be assured of it.",
  "that sucks so much.",
  "where are you located?",
  "so, i can call someone to fix it?",
  "i didnt know it started in LOCATION!",
  "do you like this one?",
  "ah-ha, i thought so.",
  "sure, what do you have?",
  "thank you.here ' s 10 $ , just give me 1 $ back, please.",
  "perhaps?",
  "it depends on what he's in.",
  "not as much",
  "lets talk about OCCUPATION next.",
  "we ’ re going to the BUSINESS.",
  "i dont watch BUSINESS.",
  "now press this PRODUCT.",
  "that's about as long as i'm thinking' i played last.",
  "i pretty sure it would.",
  "what about our PRODUCT?",
  "i am sure somewhere.",
  "i need to deposit $ 300.",
  "i wonder if anyone did?",
  "i play with some ORG every now and then.",
  "that must be so uplifting for the ORG",
  "that was in LOCATION!",
  "just a PRODUCT.",
  "when it comes to \"ACADEMIC_DISCIPLINE\".",
  "do you like jaz-z?",
  "PERSON, the actor?",
  "0h, good.",
  "no clue!",
  "that's not surprising.",
  "what does a OCCUPATION do?",
  "that ’ s not true.",
  "so that leaves friday.",
  "i know they aren't good for me, but they are cheap, convenient, and fairly tasty.",
  "i have heard of that.",
  "that's something that you really need to work on.",
  "that would be hilarious to watch!",
  "oh look!",
  "they do and it's so convenient.",
  "yeah that was not smart.",
  "i always wondered how they test that accurately.",
  "i'm sure that would be cool to hear!",
  "im going to watch tv right now.",
  "how did they not notice.",
  "really neat.",
  "they have changed everything.",
  "they perform at the FAC in dc.",
  "i ’ ve already got it.",
  "that's brilliant!",
  "yeah that is pretty hilarious actually.",
  "it would be hard to get along.",
  "i sometimes watch it.",
  "i was born here.",
  "ya he seems really smart!",
  "no, and let me tell you why...",
  "FOOD is mine.",
  "that's incredible to think about.",
  "it sounds fun.",
  "i know it's become more and more common.",
  "oh man...that's tough.",
  "ok, when and where did you last see it?",
  "it was amazing FOOD.",
  "oh, i guess i'll let you through then.",
  "that sounds goofy.",
  "that's upsetting!",
  "for the POLITICAL_PARTY in general?",
  "same with me i would like to see it done though.",
  "sure, why not?",
  "oh wow....",
  "i know there are popular.",
  "same. though with as cold as it is here.",
  "that's what they all say....",
  "that's correct.",
  "well, i suggest you just keep me posted.",
  "yeah definitely not the youngest anymore.",
  "that is very admirable!",
  "what did you do after that?",
  "i sure would hope so!",
  "i need to stop being so boring and maybe i'll get there too.",
  "he was called OCCUPATION",
  "it's sad but i have turned into the complete WORK_OF_ART!",
  "would probably have been odd to say the least.",
  "what do you FOOD?",
  "it was amusing.",
  "ok, tell me.",
  "i was unaware of that.",
  "yes they are very advanced in my NORP.",
  "true maybe i had to switch to another PRODUCT to be able to hear something less.",
  "he is also a smart OCCUPATION.",
  "well, maybe i'll tag along and watch how you talk.",
  "when i ’ m old, i ’ ll also be like that.",
  "7:30.",
  "youre right.",
  "hey, how did you know i came from LOCATION?",
  "i really like all of them.",
  "they're kinda funny.",
  "no, i didn't, because it was pretty hard.",
  "and must i go back to LOCATION?",
  "3 of those are mine.",
  "how much do ballet PRODUCT cost approximately?",
  "that would be cool to see.",
  "i just figured it would be something that would interest him.",
  "it ’ s a very quiet LOCATION.",
  "it is crazy.",
  "i've not seen those.",
  "i am really curious to hear more about that.",
  "been there since '68.",
  "i've never read it.",
  "they come in PRODUCT of ten or twenty.",
  "sure, and i'm glad to meet you.",
  "i guess someone was suing PERSON.",
  "i think that's funny.",
  "no that is really bad.",
  "that might be it.",
  "wear red PRODUCT?!",
  "i am not sure but he has released three WORK_OF_ART already",
  "oh thats nice.",
  "and if one of those doesn't interest me.",
  "ah yes i did know that.",
  "not too familiar with him.",
  "i couldn't imagine how they would feel if they just ordered a nice FOOD and had to leave!",
  "that'll be helpful.",
  "i again agree totally!!",
  "i've thought of that, but what can i do with my PRODUCT?",
  "that's super shocking.",
  "that's scary and crazy!",
  "i'm not sure i really have a favorite SPORT_TEAM.",
  "yeah. who reads those?",
  "how beautiful!",
  "ya he kicked off a NORP thats for sure.",
  "yeah and they passed on that for just $50 million.",
  "boom!",
  "i have not made it there yet",
  "yes, maybe i should.",
  "he must be.",
  "if i lived in LOCATION.",
  "can i help you, sir?",
  "how long will you be staying?",
  "hmmmm....i think that would be ugly.",
  "well personally i found myself asking if that is fair.",
  "i think they are shallow as well.",
  "i haven't watched it either.",
  "i would love to visit that FAC.",
  "i like it so far.",
  "they probably will.",
  "i did use PRODUCT.",
  "yeah but he did well.",
  "i didn't even think about that.",
  "i think i need to unplug for a while.",
  "i wonder what it sounded like.",
  "why did you shave it off?",
  "if you do, i will keep your deductible.",
  "TYPE_OF_SPORT is too long for me.",
  "i'm dead serious.",
  "ok, you can stop now.",
  "it was devastating.",
  "well, i ’ ll think about it.",
  "do you know i haven't seen on yet outside of tv?",
  "how long have you been learning it?",
  "yes it was around 1984 i think.",
  "i'll just take a FOOD.",
  "we appreciate hearing that about you!",
  "i used to listen to them when i was younger.",
  "three hundred!",
  "thats what they want to do anyway.",
  "i suppose that is true.",
  "sure, come with me.",
  "sounds as if they are fairly diversified.",
  "yea i've heard of that too.",
  "didn't i tell you?",
  "yeah i don't use it nearly as often as i used to.",
  "i am not sure but that is why they claim.",
  "i used to program them.",
  "it'll be close, but we'll make it.",
  "i doubt it is exact but it is probably pretty close.",
  "ORG...",
  "at 7 am.",
  "they were adopted rapidly in LOCATION.",
  "no, i'm not very good at it.",
  "yes, that ’ s correct.",
  "want something to drink?",
  "yeah that would have been fun to watch.",
  "it is a risky ACADEMIC_DISCIPLINE.",
  "you are always so naughty.",
  "yes, it definitely bothers me more when i do that.",
  "i believe that can be arranged.",
  "yes, it is not easy.",
  "i guess it was invented by rene \"the crocodile\" lacoste.",
  "maybe you're right.",
  "yeah i've wondered that as well.",
  "that ' s really good.",
  "it is neat that it is.",
  "that's what i figured.",
  "i really hope that's where it comes from...",
  "is everything ready now?",

  "well, it depends.",
  "i would guess that he appreciates anyone expressing political NORP.",
  "yes i wonder why that happened.",
  "where would we be without it?",
  "well, that ’ s not possible.",
  "i am not sure i saw that one.",
  "you're glad he saved me, huh?",

  "i think i heard that as well.",
  "do you think i'll forget to do it?",
  "i bet there were more available when someone else came.",
  "understandable.",
  "thats ok.",
  "that would be dangerous.",
  "he doesnt read by himself yet just looks at the WORK_OF_ART.",

  "i wonder if anyone else famous ever narrated for it.",
  "i don't believe so.",
  "i definitely like going to concerts more.",
  "i don't think so",
  "i wonder why anyone would ever need that on their PRODUCT?",
  "same here and have a good one",
  "well, that was tough.",
  "i would imagine he is now.",
  "let's just hope it doesn't get hotter.",
  "not recently.",

  "i wonder how they name their SPORT_TEAM.",
  "ya that would be interesting.",
  "that ’ s not too expensive.",
  "yeah thats really interesting.",
  "i'm not sure if that is true.",
  "should we just meet here?",
  "oh, it's out of PRODUCT.",
  "and it resulted in a LAW.",
  "you like the FOOD there?",
  "he needed a LAW like that.",

  "i heard they did that.",
  "that definitely is.",
  "sure, i'll go get it for you.",

  "i did the first one.",
  "i ’ d be glad to help.",
  "ya i wonder how that all is going to go down.",

  "yes, i will need it.",
  "i think that is so neat!!",
  "would you like me to tell you where i got mine.",
  "ok, i will remember.",
  "maybe it's LANGUAGE?",

  "is it easy to get lost?",
  "ok...",
  "yes, that would work out better.",
  "i bet those are beautiful LOCATION!",
  "i would say so!",
  "i don't know if we have anyone really famous from LOCATION.",
  "i dont think so either.",
  "i think the ORG can afford it.",
  "so when did this happen?",
  "i don't understand of myself.",
  "but it's paid off.",
  "i know and that is just weird!",
  "don't worry, it will work out fine once you get there.",
  "and do you know why they came up with that ?",
  "yeah i guess that happens as well.",
  "i'm not sure to be honest with you.",
  "maybe they thought the wh was as immortal as a FOOD.",
  "he is also the OCCUPATION of basketball!",
  "yes, i got it.",
  "i have no seen WORK_OF_ART yet.",
  "these look strange.",
  "yeah i think i read that somewhere before as well.",
  "it's forty-five PRODUCT.",
  "i would have been tempted to keep him too.",
  "uh. wonderful WORK_OF_ART.",
  "i'm not actually sure that is true.",
  "i still own a PRODUCT t from 1908.",
  "he has done tv but not by singing.",
  "i'm sure its very peaceful there.",
  "i think it's hilarious.",
  "sounds like it was meant to be.",
  "when is it most convenient for me to visit you to talk about the OCCUPATION?",
  "is it difficult to learn?",
  "that bummed me out when i heard about it.",
  "but if you hear it everyday.",
  "i read that and thought the same.",
  "we are devolving.",
  "what do you like about her ?",
  "how true!",
  "he must be lonely?",
  "so long!",
  "that's weird...",
  "i am not familiar with PERSON.",
  "this will work out well.",

  "it is the safe also.",
  "she's demanding.",
  "oh, very nice.",
  "i enjoyd chattin with you as well.",

  "oh. seems reasonable i guess.",
  "umm. too shiny.",
  "well, you sound ill over the PRODUCT.",
  "i've heard about it, but never had one.",
  "yeah unfortunately i think you would be right.",
  "i would get so bored.",
  "how much does it come up to?",
  "ya i don't watch it",
  "i think that's awesome!",
  "i could totally see that.",
  "these are our cheapest PRODUCT, madam.",
  "BUSINESS would pay the most.",
  "so long and boring sounding",
  "oh, ok.",
  "you don't need to worry about that.",
  "must be older.",
  "i'll let you know when i want you to stop.",
  "thank you, but i really want to relax myself.",

  "okay.",
  "yeah very educated",
  "yeah it is the PRODUCT.",
  "i'm not really sure.",
  "well, he should pay you back.",
  "i won't either.",
  "well, that is easy!",
  "yes that is kind of interesting and also scary.",
  "i know you're right.",
  "thank you for chatting.",
  "and they account for 33% of bandwidth in LOCATION",
  "at cars!",
  "i didn't see that one either.",
  "he is awesome.",
  "well, i think i ’ ll take it.",
  "i applied for the OCCUPATION online.",
  "are they really?",
  "i used to live in LOCATION.",
  "that's pretty good.",
  "PERSON danced ballet!",
  "i would love to hear what those sound like on the PRODUCT.",
  "she got an OCCUPATION for editing!!",
  "i'm pretty good.",
  "yeah and it just stuck around.",
  "wow i guess that is why he was so unique at it",
  "i still need to take LANGUAGE, but i really don't like writing.",
  "yeah, i want the WORK_OF_ART.",
  "it would be very interesting.",
  "that sounds better.",
  "i just recently heard about it.",
  "i ’ d really rather not.",
  "i grew up on the ORG.",
  "at least they have a PRODUCT and stick to it.",
  "yeah he was great in that for sure.",
  "that will drop as bandwidth improves.",
  "where have you traveled before?",
  "i usually shop at BUSINESS.",
  "speaking of FOOD.",
  "no, tell me more.",
  "no, i'll send a larger PRODUCT to pick you up.",
  "thats really interesting .",
  "ya they are super old.",
  "well its a violent TYPE_OF_SPORT anyway.",
  "it sounds very complicated.",
  "do you think it will help?",
  "not sure why that it is.",
  "it sure would.",
  "matthew bellamy?",
  "you guessed it.",
  "i am glad.",
  "yeah i wonder when he did that.",
  "can you tell me more?",
  "ahh...i didn't know that.",
  "very sad indeed.",
  "i do not like them.",
  "did he?",
  "i knew what you meant!",
  "i share you opinion.",
  "one would think.",
  "until 1805.",
  "seems excessive to me too.",
  "i've never heard of him.",
  "i would think so too.",
  "i am surprised there is only one to be honest.",
  "well, shall we go to the BUSINESS right now?",
  "i ’ m not sure.",
  "i bet that is a light PRODUCT.",
  "that i can't tell ya..",
  "did he leave when you left?",
  "what if we can't get to LOCATION?",
  "i actually have heard that before and wondered why we are not studying jellyfish more to find out how and why that is possible.",
  "yes i guess so!",
  "i listen to it sometimes.",
  "it certainly would have been awesome.",
  "it seems to me that you always do better than you say.",
  "not PERSON.",
  "where do i sign up for that.",
  "i did not like much WORK_OF_ART",
  "it is old.",
  "oh yeah!",
  "i wonder if anyone follows the ORG around.",
  "when he televised deciding what SPORT_TEAM he was going to play for.",
  "i like LOCATION myself.",
  "hard to believe that was that long ago.",
  "i don't remember.",
  "yeah, but that's human ACADEMIC_DISCIPLINE.",
  "i already have an BUSINESS with you, so it should be pretty straight forward.",
  "i know listening to MUSIC_GENRE still makes me smile inside.",
  "oh, how wonderful.",
  "will you be voting?",
  "i would say that is very possible indeed!",
  "i mean it's kind of true.",
  "that is certainly old.",
  "yeah i do shop at BUSINESS.",
  "so a OCCUPATION can play?",
  "that's insane.",
  "oh i think i know what you are talking about.",
  "i would think so.",
  "your ACADEMIC_DISCIPLINE is very good and that's great.",
  "it makes you wonder how that came about.",
  "i think if he has enough on PERSON.",
  "i guess they must be.",
  "3 of them really?",
  "i want to know what LANGUAGE that was!",
  "i'm not really familiar either.",
  "i'm glad he did that.",
  "yes, you will have to pay to use it.",
  "what else can we do?",
  "oh, yes, i do.",
  "wouldn't they melt?",
  "i think it was a great EVENT.",
  "no, i'm not hungry.",
  "he is at that.",
  "i'm sure it was worth it for them too!",
  "i have one.",
  "makes you wonder what else they are hiding.",
  "how i was that were real.",
  "PERSON has done well too.",
  "yes, i enjoyed it very much.",
  "i enjoy PERSON.",
  "as little as possible.",
  "i think that would be cool to see!",
  "that's scary.",
  "i already told you that i'm going to do it.",
  "it was about PRODUCT though which is very interesting.",
  "just about as much as the PRODUCT!",
  "wow eminem?",
  "oh, not bad.",
  "hmmm i wish i could explain.",
  "prince william?",
  "yes he does and it is wrong.",
  "i didn't know.",
  "that ’ s possible, but i ’ m not sure it would really happen like that.",
  "maybe he's not that busy?",
  "do you listen to the PRODUCT?",
  "i might make nothing even if i stay.",
  "that's crazy to think about.",
  "no it doesn't sound very fair either.",
  "well in LOCATION.",
  "thats insanely wasteful.",
  "yesh they allow ANIMAL though.",
  "that's good for me, but do you think you'll be back by then?",
  "i guess if they are talking about LOCATION it might qualify...",
  "do you listen to the PRODUCT much.",
  "which i find to be surprising.",
  "and after that?",
  "i'm not so sure of that.",
  "i think that you are right.",
  "i do not know whom to trust.",
  "yes, they were horrible.",
  "no, that's ok.do you have any whole wheat bread?",
  "i was wondering if you like to go to the FAC then.",
  "that's good they did.",
  "i can't recall.",
  "she probably did.",
  "this is very odd!",
  "i appreciate that.",
  "oh yeah that was back on april 18.",
  "do you want to eat FOOD here?",
  "is there anything else you use on the PRODUCT?",
  "i agree that 20 % would be just about right.",
  "you are right about that.",
  "that'll cost too much.",
  "i wonder who put it there and why.",
  "i am sorry.",
  "2014?",
  "that's incredibly interesting.",
  "that would have been really funny.",
  "i think in LOCATION.",
  "okey.",
  "i'm not entirely surprised by that.",
  "yes and he is not even mentioned in it",
  "he is too famous!",
  "i do use the FAC.",
  "nice i want to get more on BUSINESS.",
  "i cannot either.",
  "you are very nice and helpful.",
  "how much would you like to withdraw?",
  "wow i guess he was born to be a OCCUPATION.",
  "it is a pretty dangerous PRODUCT.",
  "where will those be located?",
  "that is crazy about WORK_OF_ART.",
  "i guess i was asking for too much.",
  "do you want me to fill it out now?",
  "i think i read that recently.",

  "i want to come in at 2",
  "that would be both hilarious and sad.",
  "what is fostering.",
  "i didnt know being over rated was something you could even measure.",

  "how did you grow such long PRODUCT?",
  "2430 PRODUCT.",

  "that's pretty tough!",
  "that would be good to know.",
  "alright, let's go then.",
  "mine are the SPORT_TEAM.",
  "career path?",
  "yes, our ORG is very reasonable.",
  "that's 626-555-1739.",
  "okay, let me think.",
  "i read about that.",
  "i guess the surrounding ACADEMIC_DISCIPLINE may do pretty good.",
  "i never did either.",
  "it would have been very different had they cast PERSON as they had originally planned.",
  "i am so curious about that.",
  "i wonder how they get around.",
  "yeah i'm not against it or anything.",
  "groovy man!",
  "TYPE_OF_SPORT is fun to watch.",
  "i wonder if anyone would tell him if they weren't!",
  "ringo!",
  "i am not sure but with the PRODUCT it may be obsolete.",
  "i'm glad too.",
  "do you use PRODUCT ?",
  "it is not true.",
  "ok.i'll come.",
  "i ’ m not going to tell you.",
  "could you use wooden PRODUCT instead?",
  "the giants?",
  "i am glad you are happy.",
  "where do they grow FOOD?",
  "i don't hang out there much.",
  "i watched the first WORK_OF_ART of it when i was younger.",
  "that would be interesting to listen to.",
  "you're definitely right.",
  "i'll tell you when to stop.",
  "i ’ m going as fast as i can!",
  "they are PRODUCT.",
  "but it is still enough to have enough LOCATION.",
  "we definitely are.",
  "it's only $ 20.",
  "i have never heard of any of those.",
  "still not that interested but i have seen some that weren't bad.",
  "yes, with a fine toothed PRODUCT, as usual.",
  "i think they are pretty expensive.",
  "he certainly does.",
  "that's good, i'm usually more comfortable in bigger ORG.",
  "maybe it is something that will have all have to do.",
  "i am not sure but i would like to find out...",
  "i'm afraid we have to reschedule it.",
  "you have nothing to worry about with her.",
  "hahahaa!",
  "ree?",
  "they ’ re not all right.",
  "epic fail!",
  "it does seem calming.",
  "it's a good one!",
  "how do i PRODUCT it?",
  "yes here they are much more agressive!",
  "and i did not know BUSINESS existed in 1997 and that they mailed the dvd's.",
  "i just cant see that ever happening.",
  "you should watch it.",
  "yes it's in LOCATION actually.",
  "she probably doesn't have to.",
  "the referees?",

  "yes, could you please go over this for me?",
  "i couldn't do that",
  "yes; i did watch it.",
  "i think that is hilarious!",
  "i've done it once or twice how about you?",
  "i usually watch the CHAMPIONSHIP.",
  "yeah, you ’ re right.",
  "did they really?",
  "i want $ 150.",
  "it won't play a PRODUCT.",
  "it sure is",
  "its very interesting !",
  "they have been on forever.",
  "i follow the SPORT_TEAM.",
  "i'm going to do that.",
  "she's out shopping with her ORG.",
  "i did see it and i liked it but in the uk did not do very well",
  "that is still probably less than PRODUCT.",
  "i always thought it was LOCATION.",
  "could you recall when and where you lost it?",
  "i have never heard of it.",
  "not really, but i've got used to it now.",
  "i wonder why that is?",
  "sounds fascinating.",
  "i'm not even going to try.",
  "it also was surprising that they own BUSINESS.",
  "it is MUSIC_GENRE.",
  "this is mr.PERSON.",
  "i could not believe what i was watching.",
  "yeah!",
  "thats crazy that it all takes so long.",
  "$ 500per PRODUCT?!",

  "$ 200 for double.",
  "i hate WORK_OF_ART.",
  "i wish i could have at least been outside the LOCATION looking in!",
  "203.",
  "no, we can't.",
  "it cost $50.000 to make.",
  "oh i do know this and it is so bizarre!",
  "oh wow that's funny.",
  "i like that we should adopt LAW like that here too",
  "sometimes it's hard to understand what ORG think is funny.",
  "you'll see.",
  "that is long.",
  "ok, i will prepare it right now.",
  "i heard about that one.",
  "you?",
  "yeah you're right about that.",
  "i liked how he returned to LOCATION.",
  "should we go see it?",

  "i am not afraid of them.",
  "86% of the LOCATION.",
  "i was glad to hear that.",
  "i do not like them at all.",
  "that seems very impressive.",
  "i didn't  know that.",
  "i don't see why not.",
  "ya i never heard of that.",
  "it is hardly ever used for that.though.",
  "thank you, i'll try again later.",
  "very expensive.",
  "ok, how about 12:30 pm?",
  "yeah.so cute.",
  "yeah i remember that as well.",
  "i guess FOOD is not as easy as i thought.",
  "i think i'll have a FOOD, please.",
  "it ’ s a perfectly good LOCATION.",
  "i imagine there is.",
  "i'm indifferent since i don't really watch.",
  "i could help pay for it.",

  "i really want to find out.",
  "you're moving now?",
  "you know, i could do this myself.",
  "how much do they pay?",
  "i wonder about that.",
  "they could have bought PRODUCT in 2005.",
  "it's saddening to think that over 80% of our LOCATION have been destroyed.",
  "what's strange about that!",
  "em, you ’ re right.",
  "it is impressive he must be really smart.",
  "it is ok with me.",
  "yes, i liked it, too.",
  "yeah but after that it was all down.",
  "i wonder when it is expected to available for PRODUCT.",
  "why not now?",
  "i can tell it from your PRODUCT.",
  "it is very impressive!",
  "yeah i just dont understand it.",
  "it seems longer than that.",

  "500 PRODUCT.",
  "i didn't know this very interesting.",
  "if you aren't thin, you're nobody.",
  "is that better?",

  "he was fined?",
  "yes, this is the best we can do.",
  "i always thought they were ORG.",
  "thats crazy",
  "that seems kind of unfair.",
  "maybe they can give them a WORK_OF_ART or something.",
  "almost all of them do.",
  "i haven't seen it yet either.",
  "now anyone over 13 can join!",
  "no, it's too far.",
  "has it been that long?",

  "i wonder what prompted them to change it?",
  "i'm sure they'll be fine once you break them in.",
  "1998",
  "same...",
  "just this PRODUCT.",

  "it finished in a SPORTS_SEASON.",
  "i was just wondering that also.",
  "i'll go with you.",

  "that's pretty interesting about his PRODUCT.",
  "you knew about it!",

  "it says that traditionally, give something made of PRODUCT.",
  "well i guess we don't really know.",
  "thank you for chatting with me.",
  "he was way different back then..",
  "that sounds scary to live there if they have to put those on their PRODUCT to prevent that.",
  "actually, i have to go to LOCATION right now.",
  "thomas going blue!",
  "i sure can.",
  "it's because it is so hot there.",
  "i would like to see her do it!",
  "maybe we can enjoy the tv play together.",
  "it ’ s quite large.",
  "yeah it was by BUSINESS.",
  "well, i ’ m afraid it isn ’ t.",
  "don't mention it.",
  "well it probably is both literally and figuratively",
  "well, that's only $ 4000.",
  "don ’ t say that yet.",
  "i definitely agree!",
  "are you positive that you didn't buy the PRODUCT?",
  "i am not sure as i have never owned one of those PRODUCT.",
  "i bet that was awesome to experience.",

  "i played TYPE_OF_SPORT.",
  "i can't wait to see it.",
  "i can't say i grew up without PRODUCT.",
  "i don't follow it",
  "i have not seen that yet.",
  "no i think TYPE_OF_SPORT is really boring.",
  "without him.",
  "well, i think maybe i should find a FAC that is closer to where i work.",
  "he was talented indeed.",
  "yeah he was really good.",
  "and that was the last EVENT they won until 2016.",
  "i actually knew that.",
  "PRODUCT 41.",

  "wow they have done everything.",
  "even the ORG have played 2.263 concerts.",
  "i would have given anything to be anywhere other than where i was.",
  "( later.. )",

  "but wouldn't it be better to know what could happen to be prepared for it?",
  "yes, right here.",
  "add to that.",
  "right!?!?",
  "when do they arrive in LOCATION?",
  "have you ever had a ANIMAL?",
  "you've got to let her know.",
  "booo!",
  "it is pretty crazy.",
  "that's a PRODUCT that i would definitely watch",
  "over $300.000.",
  "wow i guess that worked out pretty well for them then",
  "he is the highest paid OCCUPATION right now actually.",
  "i think i'm going to decline.",
  "i can't even imagine the WORK_OF_ART of that!",
  "i don't remember that one.",
  "are you rushing me?",
  "i really do not like them .",
  "the PRODUCT went frozen.",
  "do you think she changed because of PERSON",
  "i bet she was.",
  "that seems small.",
  "i wonder why they always have said they are?",
  "well now that you say that.",
  "no i agree with you.",
  "yeah, you are right.",
  "they really nailed it then.",
  "i won ’ t be able to pay that right now.",
  "it all depends upon what you can believe.",
  "yeah that is pretty interesting.",
  "in the ads?",
  "and most of them all move.",
  "sorry, but she's out.",
  "BUSINESS is ok.",
  "i'm thinking probably because it was cheap to get.",
  "ya!",
  "i did not participate but i should have.",
  "looked very cool.",
  "okay, i'll get you one.",
  "an art!",

  "well, isn ’ t there anything you want?",
  "p",
  "not sure must be easier for him to see.",
  "she is also very naughty.",
  "gold jerry.",
  "this surprised me.",
  "you probably have to wear it if you work for them.",
  "i guess they can trade up if they need to.",
  "he really does push forward.",
  "that is crazy and scary.",
  "why do they say that.",
  "never heard of him.",
  "ya thats cool.",
  "it must be old.",
  "i don't really",
  "she does look NATION.",
  "yeah and then after 55 about 32 million .",
  "i'm not sure what those are.",
  "i know it ’ s not.",
  "yeah i wonder what that sounds like though",
  "and he can move, too!",
  "not as much anymore.",
  "that must be a really expensive PRODUCT.",
  "i'm not sure how that is even possible.",
  "yeah i bet they are pretty expensive.",
  "yes i wonder how often they back it up too.",
  "safe travels!",
  "all of them i think.",
  "i don't think i would want to travel that fast on 4 PRODUCT.",
  "that's true",

  "another slow TYPE_OF_SPORT is fishing.",
  "which i dont think it's wrong honestly.",
  "yeah i heard more than 5 million ORG were put celebrating",
  "i dont watch often.",
  "i would pay to watch that.",
  "yes i wonder what they do with it anyways",
  "that's why you can't open it.",
  "543210.",
  "are you telling me you're not going to meet with me?",

  "don't they all",
  "neither would i!",
  "no. never tried them.",
  "not very expensive.",
  "i tend to want to believe someone who says that they have been assaulted like that...",
  "he said that he would probably invest most of it.",
  "yes it was all because they remade it verbatim",
  "i think i can find that.",
  "what happened to you?",
  "i am so surprised.",
  "thats pretty crazy huh.",
  "are they having a BUSINESS?",
  "i don't remember, but it wasn't very serious.",
  "that would be a WORK_OF_ART.",

  "the PRODUCT were well-designed and challenging.",
  "i am sure it will.",
  "it my favorite PRODUCT.",
  "i dont know about that.",
  "ok, got it, but its PRODUCT is so strange.",

  "wow i wonder why they didn't invite him.",
  "well for TYPE_OF_SPORT you need to be really tall and strong.",
  "i know i never do.",
  "true it is sometimes entertaining to watch.",
  "i think they better stick with PRODUCT and pcs",
  "maybe i could help.",
  "that is not good.",
  "ok.how much should i pay?",
  "he sure proved them wrong!",
  "that reminds me.",
  "and to drink?",
  "probably enough to make it worth it.",
  "i think that is so funny.",
  "but how would they know?",
  "need to run.",
  "well now i do.",
  "i like him to be honest.",
  "the WORK_OF_ART are much better.",

  "i have heard a little from him but not much.",
  "was that in 1975?",
  "i cant seem to end this!",
  "i think i saw the same one.",
  "tupac is a dancer?",
  "i like ORG so much better.",
  "i'm not sure what that means?",
  "probably for the best.",
  "he should.",
  "that is very creative.",
  "i wonder if those still hold up.",
  "if i remember right.",
  "it is, isn ’ t it?",
  "its all an LAW.",
  "i'm not sure who he plays for.",
  "do you have the ORG to save me if anything should happen?",
  "i would have to agree with you on that.",
  "oh wow that's awesome.",
  "that is crazy to think about.",
  "that must be an interesting PRODUCT to listen to.",
  "do you prepare some FOOD for me?",
  "yes, she does.",
  "do you want to get something to eat later?",
  "do you know where in pa?",
  "i do watch tv mostly BUSINESS.",
  "is there anything else i should do?",
  "ok, i'll listen to you.",
  "uh, yes, okay.",
  "they are required by LAW that is why",
  "seems like PERSON really wanted to be conservational.",
  "i have seen a big PRODUCT.",
  "that is really impressive.",
  "that seems a little crazy.",
  "but it hurts too much.",
  "i'm not sure actually.",
  "not bad, but i'm a little tired.",
  "oh thats cool.",
  "that's really convenient.",
  "if only he knew it.",
  "yes i know i should not share PRODUCT",
  "i am with you on that its getting shaky in their ORG.",
  "never mind.",
  "they are forced to use traditional WORK_OF_ART.",
  "i ’ m afraid you ’ re right.",
  "you aren't the only one.",
  "i surely do.",
  "that is so true now.",
  "okay, try this PRODUCT.",
  "some ORG were meant to tour until they drop dead.",
  "i dont think so but it should!",
  "it really is a EVENT.",
  "i was vaguely aware of it.",
  "yes that would be very cool.",
  "i ’ m a OCCUPATION.",
  "that pretty cool.",
  "it ’ s",
  "i would like to.",
  "i wonder how that would work now?",
  "i would say maybe 70%.",
  "i think that actually helps",
  "he also loves the WORK_OF_ART a little too much.",
  "yes me too!",
  "im glad it wasn't.",
  "i've thought about that myself.",
  "well, i'm not sure.",
  "that's pretty surprising.",
  "i am really enjoying it here so far.",
  "that is pretty cool of him.",
  "do you want anything to make you feel better?",
  "it's all LANGUAGE to me.",
  "i see why it lags behind other LOCATION.",
  "suppose to be deciding.",
  "hi.",
  "yes actually he's from LOCATION.",
  "thats crazy and i used to think i read fast.",
  "it seems like a PRODUCT i'd be interested to watch!",
  "yeah thats impressive.",
  "yeah i'm not sure.",
  "i did, but he wasn't able to either.",
  "where to meet?",
  "oh great, i ’ ll see you there!",
  "speaking of ANIMAL.",
  "you are sounding like we are already married.",
  "i'd love to visit LOCATION.",
  "it doesn't surprise me that much.",
  "i guess ours is pretty good then?",
  "i think the ORG skew pretty young.",
  "ya that is surprising.",
  "now would be better.",
  "i have it right here.",
  "any ACADEMIC_DISCIPLINE we will talk about ?",
  "she is entertaining.",
  "i always thought it was funny that he married someone named PERSON.",
  "there was one other who didn't.",
  "i suppose they do at that.",
  "i wonder how they accidentally became photographed?",
  "that's not like you to generalize.",
  "no, he didn't!",
  "ok, i understand.",
  "not as many as i used too.",
  "considering that she's now pregnant.",
  "i have not looked at the LOCATION recently.",
  "she is 17.",
  "there sure could.",
  "actually yes.",
  "huh weird have you listened to that?",
  "where do we begin?",
  "i would like to see him in more interesting WORK_OF_ART.",
  "can any mp make a LAW?",
  "i guess so...",
  "it would be cool to see?",
  "i think i would too.",
  "oh i didn't know that .",
  "really... that's awesome!",
  "do you ever use PRODUCT?",
  "i will not be home.",
  "i only saw it once and nodded off during it.",
  "as sad as it is.",
  "i went to ORG.",
  "it is PRODUCT.",
  "thank you, you are very kind!",
  "yeah. to be honest that is probably for the best.",
  "i'm hungry.",
  "you're a really good FOOD.",
  "unfortunately.",
  "twenty five PRODUCT is a little expensive.",
  "i would think there would be.",
  "that would be fun to do!",
  "maybe that's why it's watched more.",
  "how about 60 % for the first PRODUCT, then 20 % each?",
  "how many EVENT have you gone to?",
  "yeah and also start training the ORG better.",
  "that wouldn't seem right.",
  "i do use PRODUCT but not as much as i used too.",
  "at 10,45.",
  "what else?",
  "i might get one too, but in a different PRODUCT.",
  "you do the same!",
  "i'm amazed that you can get PRODUCT there.",
  "i'm actually not surprised by that.",
  "i think it would sell.",
  "it kinda makes since you kick it and operate like TYPE_OF_SPORT.",
  "ok, that's right.",
  "i think so",
  "PERSON is hilarious though.",
  "that is easy to get distracted with.",
  "i ’ ve been looking forward to meeting you.",
  "oh, the policeman's coming.",
  "oh, it's nothing.",
  "let's go sit in the LOCATION.",
  "oh, let me see.",
  "that's a pretty neat ORG!",
  "it's normal.",
  "i know it would be very entertaining.",
  "yeah it is ORG",
  "you should!",
  "i think that it should be a national EVENT.",
  "but in their NORP.",
  "i don't even know who he is.",
  "maybe so.",
  "sounds impossible.",
  "if you do this again, don't even bother coming home.",
  "me too!!",
  "i think PRODUCT is very useful.",
  "no, not that one.",
  "i believe that to be true.",
  "that's nuts because TYPE_OF_SPORT isn't that popular!",
  "no i haven't heard much about that.",
  "kathy!",
  "that ’ s correct.",
  "i didn't realize there was one.",
  "you guessed right.",
  "you are probably right.",
  "i guess PRODUCT was more available.",
  "its pretty crazy.",
  "and then replaced them with PRODUCT.",
  "that's is a tough one.",
  "i bet so too.",
  "yes, that sounds like what i want.",
  "cats too!",
  "you have to wonder?",
  "oh, that's easy for me.",
  "oh, i forgot to bring it.",
  "oh, look at her.",
  "well... the FOOD sounds good!",
  "that is what i am looking for.",
  "that quite interesting actually.",
  "yes, may i have some more FOOD?",
  "well, i guess you don't want this WORK_OF_ART, then.",
  "that's a great one!",
  "they refuse to because they think it makes them look stupid.",
  "too bad i missed it.",
  "what's your PRODUCT no.?",
  "we don't know.",
  "they do, but they're a little expensive on certain PRODUCT.",
  "why don't you make some FOOD?",
  "that's pretty spooky.",
  "i do remember it.",
  "i'm not sure it is true.",
  "that's not fair.",
  "that would be cool to find that PRODUCT.",
  "it sounds really interesting and fun.",
  "so i need to do something too.",
  "not sure maybe it will be on BUSINESS someday.",
  "i think it's amazing.",
  "yes i wonder how much LOCATION that takes up.",
  "oh my that is too much talking without stopping",
  "the c64!",
  "can we solve this later?",
  "i like WORK_OF_ART.",
  "i think it is amazing that it has been around since 1989.",
  "it's amazing how far the PRODUCT has spread.",
  "i'm afraid i can't agree with you there.",
  "oh the memories!",
  "have you been using anything for it?",
  "that too for sure.",
  "and not expensive either.",
  "no i don't know.",
  "that ’ s horrible.",
  "you know i have heard that.",
  "you were so happy, weren ’ t you?",
  "i ’ m ready and willing to help.",
  "doing well.",
  "i did see that which is pretty cool.",
  "well i hope so.",
  "EVENT can be very stimulating but also very underwhelming or disappointing if they're not organized correctly.",
  "i would watch.",
  "yes, i ’ m pretty sure.",
  "like.",
  "i have heard of him.",
  "nothing would get accomplished.",
  "don't really remember.",
  "they dont?",
  "he is everybody's WORK_OF_ART.",
  "they missed out on that one huh.",
  "i know that seems really crazy.",
  "nice to talk with.",
  "it is strange.",
  "ok, we'll be expecting you at 11:30 then.",
  "no, it isn't strange at all.",
  "i wonder how big they were?",
  "i just wish she'd tour more.",
  "how do you research your WORK_OF_ART?",
  "yes thanks and have a good one",
  "now i think that's ridiculous.",
  "i actually do not.",
  "they have become so big now.",
  "indeed they must have been.",
  "i've actually been busy lately.",
  "i think it may.",
  "i usually fly if international and drive around.",
  "it's kind of cool, isn't it?",
  "that's pretty nice of him to do.",
  "that is so touching.",
  "i'll say, she is really stacked, isn't she?",
  "he must be very smart.",
  "have you ever used a rotary PRODUCT?",
  "t?",
  "our's too.",
  "that would be pretty neat to go see if you are in the LOCATION.",
  "i used to but not any more.",
  "i feel like that is a little NORP.",
  "i need to stand behind this WORK_OF_ART.",
  "yes, it's 110,000 rib.so, with the down payment done, i will need to borrow 70,000 rib.",
  "i believe in that.",
  "i am not sure on that one.",
  "is this one PRODUCT for you?",
  "i love traveling.",
  "i havent been following them.",
  "no, don't need, i can do myself.",
  "yeah that doesn't sound necessary.",
  "well i don't think it's staying like it.",
  "yes, i almost slid too.",
  "then they stopped winning all together.",
  "i can tell you where i got mine, if you'd like.",
  "i guess i can kind of see it.",
  "no i didnt know they were close.",
  "that is what i mean.",
  "it looks wonderful.",
  "basically just by scoring so often with them.",
  "have you been to an EVENT?",
  "we wake up early and go to FAC.",
  "i ’ ll be ready.",
  "oh, that's fine.",
  "double trouble!",
  "( PRODUCT )",
  "i cant say that i am.",
  "yeah good for him.",
  "yeah i got to give to PERSON's on that one.",
  "i like to paint.",
  "let me think...",
  "there really was.",
  "i didn ’ t even bother to think of that.",
  "i am for it.",
  "yeah i guess that would be fitting since she is so young.",
  "is there anything else bothering you?",
  "yeah impressive.",
  "i wonder what LANGUAGE?",
  "why don ’ t you go ahead of me?",
  "that is sad for the SPORT_TEAM who traded.",
  "i did't know he wrote WORK_OF_ART.",
  "id be interested to hear those!",
  "that is important.",
  "if so, i'd better try another BUSINESS.",
  "i would love to see her live as well.",
  "but it will help you keep fit.",
  "he is so humorous.",
  "ya he was too good.",
  "i have wondered that.",
  "you are right about that!",
  "don't be silly.",
  "ok, will do.",
  "no i haven't.",
  "if you move out before then, you will not get your deductible.",
  "i still don't believe that.",
  "i guess he just wants to remain positive.",
  "so what happened?",
  "i'm heading to LOCATION in may.",
  "yeah that would be interesting.",
  "might have been as well.",
  "what do you suggest?",
  "that's exactly why i vote.",

  "they are spying on us.",
  "that does.",
  "and why not?",
  "oh..",
  "i never heard that before!",
  "no, not really.",
  "i think i know it.",
  "i think yes.",
  "PERSON is awesome.",
  "i've actually never tired.",
  "everything!",
  "so, do you think our BUSINESS will be eligible for this?",
  "are indoor TYPE_OF_SPORT popular?",
  "that is very shocking.",
  "no i have not heard about that.",
  "it's still very far away.",
  "i heard about this ORG.",
  "ahh ok i didn't even think of that.",
  "that's weird.",
  "i am sad too.",
  "i do like to travel.",
  "it's mild, but it's not always pleasant.",
  "i think everyone voting should have to vote for someone.",
  "only $ 29.95?",

  "i am not sure but that sounds really sketchy...",
  "i am sure if you had studied, you would have done well.",
  "well i am really bad at dancing actually",
  "is your FAC well-lit?",
  "they definitely must at that.",
  "it evolves.",
  "that is so nice of you.",
  "i think the EVENT 1886 is very important.",
  "ya that is what i've heard as well.",
  "it's not bad.",
  "not as much as i used to.",
  "would you like another FOOD?",
  "so will",
  "nice talking with you too.",
  "listen!",
  "i hope she ’ ll recover soon.",
  "i didn't know that either",
  "only 40?",
  "i am not sure what to make of that.",
  "those are definitely entertaining.",
  "peter!",
  "yes, you are always popular with everyone.",
  "that is because they can calm down ANIMAL and protect them if it need be",
  "i don't even know if it still exists.",
  "yep i wonder if they still do that.",
  "i ’ m not going to be able to vote this tuesday.",
  "it was before PRODUCT.",
  "i was thinking about it.",
  "that must irk him.",
  "i'm not really daring.",
  "nice!",
  "hmm i wonder.",
  "yes i would also.",
  "i wonder why it was so short lived.",
  "they deserved it.",
  "please.",
  "now that i think about it, i can see how you missed it.",
  "i haven't either.",
  "that's very true!",
  "i think it's stupid too.",
  "yeah they are concerning.",
  "if you could, would you please talk to him?",
  "i bet it was pretty good.",
  "very oddly indeed.",
  "that sounds inspiring.",
  "how do i know if it's ripe?",
  "i guess he started early.",
  "i'm sorry, but if it breaks down, you're on your own.",
  "wow i didn't know about that.",
  "5?",
  "it's over there.",
  "yeah that is pretty crazy..",
  "that's cool.",
  "i'd like to hear that.",
  "yeah i think it does as well.",
  "that does sound fun!",
  "i thought that too.",
  "no i don't have PRODUCT",
  "i am worried as well.",
  "it is more extreme but definitely enjoyable.",
  "i would only play TYPE_OF_SPORT.",
  "not sure you meant to send that!",
  "i'm bald too !",
  "could you tell me how much i owe?",
  "i do travel.",
  "i'm moving to LOCATION!",
  "i'd like to.",
  "no, you're right.",
  "that would really make it hard to get the LOCATION mowed huh.",
  "well, eight hundred, then?",
  "i vote.",
  "i think it is weird.",
  "well we are just using up all the natural LOCATION arent we.",
  "that would be awesome to see.",
  "yes they didn't know what they missed out on.",
  "yes i just recently learned that.",
  "must have been bad.",
  "yeah i know thats crazy.",
  "it was funny.",
  "i know - i researched it because you asked me about it.",
  "i would love to visit there.",
  "i wonder too but then again.",
  "that is pretty weird.",
  "yeah i don't think we will.",
  "i'm not that behind.",
  "i haven't seen any of them yet.",
  "educated for sure.",
  "and when is your son's EVENT?",
  "that's pretty extreme.",
  "yeah about 180 of them.",
  "why was that?",
  "i thought that was kind of crazy too!",
  "where is it?",
  "he's richer than WORK_OF_ART?",
  "yep you would think that.",
  "i used to listen to the PRODUCT when i was young.",
  "really enjoyed chatting with you.",
  "which is basically when you get on",
  "i would have said a 3.",
  "that seems really stupid to me.",
  "that's right.",
  "you should go.",
  "ya that is insane.",
  "why didn't you return the PRODUCT or exchange it?",
  "i think it is very necessary for us.",
  "thats pretty cool.",
  "ok. will do!",
  "okay, let me see what we have.",
  "no, i don't have it with me.",
  "what??",
  "i don't play either.",
  "yeah he surely has contributed greatly to our ACADEMIC_DISCIPLINE.",
  "i wonder how they are better.",
  "that's bizarre.",
  "mine are, too.",
  "yea i never get how that works actually so it is too bad that that happens",
  "i've read PRODUCT.",
  "i did watch SPORTS_EVENT though i was just busy eating.",
  "now that was next to nothing!",
  "oh, it's really beautiful.",
  "i have thought about it for a while.",
  "i did and it was good but in the uk it did not do very well",
  "i am that good.",
  "i have never read it.",
  "i think i'll be a little afraid.",
  "that's fun!",
  "interesting...a giant WORK_OF_ART!",
  "i have really found the more i read.",
  "there is a free PRODUCT that i used to use but i now pay for it.",
  "i thought about that ha.",
  "it's delicious.",
  "i heard it used to be a married ORG.",
  "he definitely did!",
  "and it wasnt discontinued in LOCATION until 2003!",
  "that is nice that they do that.",
  "i my ORG are naive as well.",
  "i don't know them.",
  "well worth the WORK_OF_ART.",
  "if they were old enough i would probably check just to be sure.",
  "that would be very useful.",
  "i'm sure it will, if we are appointed your OCCUPATION.",
  "so they say.",
  "i've heard about LOCATION.",
  "that was pretty neat.",
  "next monday.",
  "that's pretty sweet.",
  "do you sell PRODUCT here?",
  "then again.",
  "go for it!",
  "i have not read any WORK_OF_ART by him.",
  "i read that.",
  "mr. PERSON, we will be expecting you this tuesday at 7",
  "it looks new.",
  "i am a prime OCCUPATION.",
  "i read that as well.",
  "dealing with rental BUSINESS is so frustrating.",
  "yes, twice.",
  "i think  it does.",
  "PRODUCT  5.5 hours.",
  "i don't miss that much.",
  "nope i think i got rid of them all they kind of seem to disappear into the first WORK_OF_ART of the 2000s.",
  "i don't think i can afford that.",
  "that happens to be my favorite.",
  "i didnt thats interesting.",
  "i do enjoy both.",
  "those are pretty good.",
  "i know that mj wore them despite the LAW.",
  "oh, that suits you very well.",
  "yeah with all PRODUCT available.",
  "i do sometimes ya.",
  "that's great of ORG.",
  "i honestly even don't have tv home.",
  "ah yeah.",
  "i haven't seen that show yet.",
  "i do like WORK_OF_ART!",
  "wow... that's so awesome!",
  "it costs over $300 to travel across the LOCATION.",
  "i find that hard to believe.",
  "are you into PRODUCT ?",
  "i read PERSON mostly.",
  "it will....",
  "that is so funny",
  "that's idealistic.",
  "i think it's too short.",
  "you're right they were all good.",
  "ok i can go with that.",
  "haaaaa!",
  "yes, 20 % would be perfect.",
  "i have cut all of my PRODUCT as well.",
  "should i do anything else?",
  "i'm not sure i know that one.",
  "where'd you get those?",
  "i am indifferent to them.",
  "loretta?",
  "oh, that's what you think, huh?",
  "that's great, see you at seven.",
  "how is it?",
  "nope i agree with you.",
  "no didn't know that.",
  "i actually dont know.",
  "it is in PRODUCT an i am still trying to learn how to read it",
  "even though it sounds worse.",
  "it looks goofy but PERSON used it.",
  "that would be cool to listen to.",
  "we can sleep together.",
  "that's good, we can share what we have.",
  "it is about vp PERSON.",
  "i use it sometimes.",
  "i think i heard about that.",
  "don't worry, i will come to pick you up at about six thirty.",
  "i never learned.",
  "they are all produced in LOCATION, aren't they?",
  "i always suspected that that was a NORP.",
  "it's better for you.",
  "it was awesome.",
  "i like both!",
  "do you own an PRODUCT ?",
  "it's a private LOCATION.",
  "i wonder if the FAC can even be sold.",
  "i guess if you are important enough you can get PRODUCT anywhere.",
  "that does not surprise me.",
  "oh yeah for sure.",
  "well that's impressive.",
  "oh, is it?",
  "do you think they'd hire me?",
  "he was in house.",
  "yep i'm not sure actually.",
  "thats a good one.",
  "well if it was cloned in LOCATION.",
  "just imagine if that was our OCCUPATION....",
  "oh, this is just fine.",
  "we can do that, but it will cost...",
  "that is because TYPE_OF_SPORT is the most popular internationally",
  "they must be tired when they land.",
  "yes i think he would probably get blown out but it would be cool to see.",
  "what was she wearing?",
  "i really don't know, but i don't think she gave out that many yet.",
  "that is so sad and so wrong.",
  "i wonder why though.",
  "what are you best at?",
  "yeah it was PERSON",
  "i'm sure many are content where they are.",
  "yeah  i guess PRODUCT are becoming obsolete.",
  "i've heard that",
  "oh yeah that was it.",
  "LOCATION in california?",
  "i wonder why that is.",
  "what's up?",
  "maybe he's gifted in that.",
  "sad how he was slain on the LOCATION.",
  "it is 160 000 PRODUCT.",
  "i don't understand either.",
  "no i wondered that too.",
  "i haven't heard about it?",
  "he probably never took a PRODUCT.",
  "that is pretty cool i have to say.",
  "that's just plain crazy!",
  "i think it does.",
  "why do they serve up the FOOD first?",
  "yes, i can adjust to anything.",
  "actually he is the richest...",
  "you can do it.",
  "that is true.",
  "how do you know whether you should hit the solid or the striped one?",
  "similarly.",
  "yeah it sounds like he did.",
  "i can't even imagine.",
  "here you are.",
  "ur, it stinks!",
  "he is iconic himself.",
  "oh that's too bad.",
  "oh oh...",
  "i just want to remind you to behave yourself.",
  "it is interesting!",
  "yes, i think i am.",
  "rap!",
  "i used to love it.",
  "there are thirteen of them.",
  "he's annoying.",
  "matrix themed!",
  "ok.i understand.",
  "why did they ban that PRODUCT?",
  "yeah that sounds like it would hurt.",
  "i did when i was younger.",
  "it is pretty annoying.",
  "i want to check this PRODUCT out.",
  "i'm confused.",
  "yes i enjoyed it as well.",
  "not since i found out they were made in NATION.",
  "i do like him",
  "haha well i am sure they are trying!",
  "sounds like something the ORG would do.",
  "no i have never heard of him!",
  "do you think we should try some deep fried FOOD?",
  "what's there after that?",
  "well, i can try, what do you need?",
  "bingo!",
  "did you know that PERSON.",
  "i didn't know it did that good.",
  "they certainly use it for good too.",
  "i believe he was.",
  "he did i agree.",
  "i am not sure what to make of it.",
  "PRODUCT :)",
  "no. never did.",
  "this is the PRODUCT.",
  "i have not heard that.",
  "my PRODUCT is smashed in.",
  "i wish i had gotten into acting.",
  "haha well i liked it too!",
  "here we are.",
  "how is that even possible?",
  "they are usually on BUSINESS and wb",
  "that would be interesting to ride!",
  "you can't beat that.",
  "that is really funny!",
  "you know something else?",
  "tell him i telephoned.",
  "oh, it's really fabulous.",
  "i am super guilty of not reading them.",
  "ya i rarely watch it.",
  "yeah i think everyone has to if they want to stay relevant.",
  "the ORG is powerful.",
  "was he with someone else?",
  "he does.",
  "nope i should check it out i guess.",
  "that is pretty cool actually.",
  "noway!",
  "i think it would be relaxing as well.",
  "it's good to learn.",
  "that would be so weird.",
  "that's very close to me.",
  "yes, that's the right PRODUCT, but it's so heavy.",
  "that is too expensive.",
  "now that you mention it i do somewhat remember seeing how he did that.",
  "i love it as well.",
  "that happened in 1964.",
  "it ’ s a great LOCATION.",
  "oh, yes?",
  "no. who created fox news?",
  "oh i'm sure a few of us would have done something stupid.",
  "that is pretty impressive for the SPORT_TEAM.",
  "not bad i guess.",
  "no, that ’ s not true.",
  "i hope that it has something to think about.",
  "very much so.",
  "she was!",
  "ya that is shocking to me that they make that much.",
  "but you can't use so much.",
  "enter your PRODUCT.",
  "it's the same as usual.",
  "i do remember that!",
  "that was amazing.",
  "apparently from 9pm to 12am it accounts for 33% of all bandwidth.",
  "yeah. never been there though.",
  "seems like a good OCCUPATION.",
  "PERSON was so wonderful.",
  "that is amazing to learn.",
  "i should google an PRODUCT of it.",
  "there will be soon enough.",
  "i didnt know someone could get baned because of that.",
  "you are so careless.",
  "i think it was in the early WORK_OF_ART.",
  "probably looks like a 2year old WORK_OF_ART :)",
  "he likes to think so!",
  "i am going to have to look those up.",
  "you weren't missing much.",
  "very relaxing!",
  "that's surprising",
  "when i was little.",
  "sadly.",
  "do i need to do anything else after i turn in the PRODUCT?",
  "and i bet WORK_OF_ART are totally different from what we have imagined.",
  "do you ever listen to the PRODUCT?",
  "oh, this feels very nice.",
  "that is certainly possible.",
  "maybe so - or even on PRODUCT.",
  "ah ... that's a little scary.",
  "everything i got from BUSINESS cost me a couple thousand.",
  "it sure is convenient.",
  "there, how ’ s that?",
  "whoa i would like to see that.",
  "when can you begin?",
  "i need to sign up for that.",
  "mmmm... that does sound interesting.",
  "if you don't get struck by it!",
  "you hair is definitely fresh and PRODUCT looking.",
  "i enjoyed chatting!",
  "well, this might be silly.",
  "i'll bring it over.",
  "interesting...",
  "where were you born?",
  "i bet it wasnt really fast.",
  "it's both affordable and it comes with all the PRODUCT.",
  "that is very resourceful of them!",
  "it is because of atmospheric ACADEMIC_DISCIPLINE.",
  "yes but i heard in the uk did not go very well.",
  "oh, is that so?",
  "no. he hasn't seen that one.",
  "i guess i should just withdraw everything.",
  "i wouldn't even know.",
  "it does?",
  "in the LOCATION.",
  "i also find that fascinating.",
  "i follow the CHAMPIONSHIP when it is on.",
  "yes, they are all distinctive NATION.",
  "sounds oxymoronic.",
  "yeah i think you are right on that.",
  "agree on that.",
  "i didnt know that i wonder if he was any good",
  "i would have fallen asleep.",
  "i'm still bitter about that.",
  "again... don't watch him if you don't like what he is saying.",
  "i liked the PRODUCT myself.",
  "that is crazy and suprising.",
  "..and what did they came up with ? ;)",
  "well, you know me.",
  "wow how is that even possible.",
  "it's very easy to find.",
  "ahah he sounds like he'd be funny.",
  "it would have been so much better with PERSON!",
  "yeah i hope it does for sure.",
  "here's good one.",
  "i don't get it.",
  "well, i can ’ t just imagine it.",
  "do you PRODUCT it ?",
  "if you like, you can apply right now.",
  "that's so dumb.",
  "yes i suppose so.",
  "you are!",
  "no, the other one... yes.",
  "i would do it.",
  "but it won ’ t be on my EVENT.",
  "you need to be interviewed over the PRODUCT.",
  "what exactly happened",
  "that is tremendous.",
  "you are not serious?",
  "i would be impressed too!",
  "that ’ s ok.thank you for seeing me.",
  "oh that's really interesting!",
  "ya it must be.",
  "go and get it repaired.",
  "haven't seen that one yet.",
  "maybe they can get it back together.",
  "well, my PRODUCT is too low for me.",
  "sounds real good.",
  "he is so rich and able to afford a personal PRODUCT.",
  "seems kind of tacky...",
  "there probably are.",
  "no, what is it?",
  "i would throw a payless PRODUCT.",
  "a FOOD, please.",
  "do i have to change?",
  "admittedly.",
  "it seems complicated but who knows.",
  "hmm...that is interesting.",
  "i believe they were a rental BUSINESS?",
  "no, i shall faint.",
  "start in LOCATION and then see where that leads you.",
  "i believe he violated his LAW.",
  "i don't like that to be honest.",
  "no, i am not.",
  "i definitely see why you got out of that.",
  "that's just not right.",
  "yes that is very amazing.",
  "ive actually tried this with my snowboarding PRODUCT it works great!",
  "what gunman ?",
  "yeah that would be great.",
  "interesting and apparently he is super good at PRODUCT.",
  "what do we use ACADEMIC_DISCIPLINE to understand?",
  "it's made of PRODUCT.",
  "you ’ d have to remember that anything you said or did might reflect on the ORG, so you ’ d really need to be very careful.",
  "i think i would have to vote for him.",
  "i find that disturbing as it is a free LOCATION.",
  "they are very interesting indeed!",
  "maybe because it's shorter and easier to remember.",
  "what do they like or dislike.",
  "ya i think they're cursed or something?",
  "i don't worry about that.",
  "i couldn't agree with you more!",
  "thankfully.",
  "at least in LOCATION.",
  "i promise the next EVENT i have we're coming to visit.",
  "oh yeah what did it do?",
  "i'm going to guess he was afraid of what will happen when they release him.",
  "it provides so much PRODUCT.",
  "oh, she is.",
  "$40?",
  "it's all the same to me.",
  "i would like to listen to a few of those.",
  "4434 1234 5678 9902.",
  "no i didn't what is that about?",
  "the cha cha winner!",
  "oh i think so too.",
  "that would help so much here.",
  "just two.",
  "that sounds awful.",
  "eating here or to go?",
  "and you'll have to sell your PRODUCT.",
  "i would highly recommend them.",
  "this PRODUCT sells for $ 39.99.",
  "that would have been sweet!",
  "aw.",
  "i usually use BUSINESS.",
  "yeah i recently read that.",
  "the other is  TYPE_OF_SPORT.",
  "it has been great chatting with you!",
  "it is genuine, isn't it?",
  "i do?",
  "you are absolutely right there.",
  "i never thought about that.",
  "still.",
  "there are it's crazy!",
  "i really like BUSINESS.",
  "baby.",
  "you got that right.",
  "why!",
  "you are right, i guess.",
  "yes i think it still has a PRODUCT.",
  "that i'm not too sure.",
  "no, not yet.",
  "i think they are paid pretty well.",
  "i know that is kind of crazy.",
  "ok, let me try it on.",
  "yeah i bet that too.",
  "i wonder if he is allergic to FOOD.",
  "everything sounds great then!",
  "you can have a different PRODUCT, but you have to pay more if it costs more.",
  "it has!",
  "they must be shocking if they have solar PRODUCT",
  "that's all you have to do.",
  "he was actually banned from PRODUCT because of that",
  "it probably does.",
  "it is a great EVENT.",
  "no, it is not here.",
  "for how long?",
  "oh i totally agree with you.",
  "you won a EVENT?",
  "i agree...",
  "thank you as well.",
  "canada?",
  "legal ACADEMIC_DISCIPLINE.",
  "you're smart.",
  "wow i guess he was good at multiple TYPE_OF_SPORT.",
  "i wonder if they are allowed to dunk.",
  "no, that should be it.",
  "why would they do that ?",
  "i definitely like the PRODUCT blue as well.",
  "i remember that and felt she deserved it!!",
  "i'm not sure but imagine if they patented it or trademarked it.",
  "i wonder what's special about LOCATION.",
  "i bet you that she regrets what she's done.",
  "well we will see where it goes.",
  "where were you at?",
  "i guess not.",
  "that will never happen.",
  "how long will it take us to get there?",
  "who's paul bettany?",
  "that is not too surprising.",
  "yeah i think he is into NORP.",
  "fabulous.",
  "yeah, sure.",
  "yeah that is something indeed.",
  "i have not heard of them before actually.",
  "if it does, it will only make you more productive, because we can support each other.",
  "yeah, it was a good christmas.",
  "not well.",
  "i don't follow them that closely.",
  "there must have been something unique about that PRODUCT.",
  "faulty PRODUCT?",
  "we're rather busy right now.",
  "i was thinking that i should have my new PRODUCT delivered as we are moving in.",
  "i've never used one before.",
  "well, i think we should go now.",
  "it's not on this LOCATION.",
  "hahahhaaa!",
  "ORG does that?",
  "isn't it amazing?",
  "man.",
  "i have never heard that before!",
  "well, obviously, what you ’ re doing is not good enough!",
  "$ 308!",
  "have you ever wrestled?",
  "yeah and they still use more on PRODUCT than on bandwidth",
  "i simply just know enough to comprehend how that would work.",
  "i like it and used to play.",
  "maybe, what shall i do now?",
  "all right, come back and bring your id.",
  "yes i wonder as well.",
  "that's good to know, because i do travel quite frequently.",
  "yes i think it was from 1789 until 1913.",
  "yes i would look that up too!",
  "that PRODUCT over there, but please be careful with it.",
  "why should i wear a PRODUCT?",
  "i cant seem to remember that one.",
  "you're like the tenth OCCUPATION to say that.",
  "oh no, this PRODUCT gets dirty very easily and it's difficult to clean.",
  "i was in my mid-20s when it came out..",
  "oh, i'm so sorry.",
  "certainly, they did.",
  "i couldn't even stand on it and hold the PRODUCT.",
  "that's pretty interesting!",
  "yeah i think you might be right about that.",
  "thats unfortunate.",
  "i wish i had solar PRODUCT.",
  "i agree i'm not sure how he would sound.",
  "yes and also the only losing OCCUPATION there",
  "okay, see you around.",
  "no i have not yet.",
  "i could do that -- i'm great at writing terrible sentences.",
  "i buy everything from amazon!",
  "how about there?",
  "i am not familiar with that one.",
  "i found some PRODUCT that are not from here.",
  "do you have id?",
  "there are too many WORK_OF_ART to catch up and memorize.",
  "i might have to watch that one.",
  "1:30 p. m.",
  "i am unsure.",
  "did you know that bird's PRODUCT are hollow?",
  "that's what i thought...",
  "i have thought about solar PRODUCT but i can't afford them.",
  "that's what i've heard too.",
  "could you fill out this PRODUCT?",
  "maybe they don't travel often.",
  "that would sound right.",
  "yeah it definitely seems slow paced which i dislike.",
  "that's not too bad.",
  "what did you enjoy the most?",
  "actually, i do.",
  "wow i can see why then.",
  "yep the PRODUCT is fun.",
  "i don't know any ACADEMIC_DISCIPLINE.",
  "how time flies!",
  "that is pretty impressive!",
  "thats where you look yourself up on the LOCATION.",
  "then he was drafted first overall.",
  "why don't you make me some oatmeal and FOOD?",
  "now the BUSINESS is worth over 100 billion and just going up further",
  "same.",
  "they always seem to be a dominant SPORT_TEAM.",
  "i'm not sure it will happen.",
  "is that am or fm PRODUCT?",
  "were your ORG upset that they weren't there to see you get married?",
  "if they were still around.",
  "huge!",
  "BUSINESS is huge.",
  "i'd rather be cold than hot.",
  "ya i own an PRODUCT",
  "is there a BUSINESS nearby?",
  "that could be pretty interesting!",
  "yeah something about WORK_OF_ART not being positive.",
  "no, i can't see that happening.",
  "do you play TYPE_OF_SPORT well?",
  "allow me to apologize.",
  "i think they should be limited.",
  "thats great",
  "that was a frustrating PRODUCT for sure.",
  "well, i certainly did.",
  "even though we do not have that PRODUCT yet i am sure we will.",
  "i agree there.",
  "that'd be very helpful.",
  "505.",
  "please use the PRODUCT.",
  "i did not know that.",
  "i would have to go for the ORG again!",
  "that's hilarious and cute too!",
  "wow i can't imagine that.",
  "yes she was amazing.",
  "yeah i don't understand that",
  "nice talking to you as well.",
  "yeah i hear about that a while back.",
  "... yeah.",
  "i thought it was some edgy.",
  "i am sorry.sir.",
  "the more expensive, the better.",
  "yes i don't watch it much either.",
  "i know, but i still get my LAW, right?",
  "febreeze?",
  "okay, so on friday, you can buy yourself something to eat.",
  "that sounds awesome.",
  "i believe that is the same BUSINESS.",
  "yeah he was.",
  "yeah like 4 or 5 by now not really sure.",
  "it is rather addicting.",
  "yeah. right.",
  "i have several.",
  "PRODUCT out.",
  "i think that says more about us as a LOCATION.",
  "here, i ’ ll help you type one up.",
  "that does sound funny!",
  "will i be finished then?",
  "i'm sure that could get pretty annoying when visiting.",
  "do you think anyone can really understand that without being told...?",
  "i think they do too.",
  "do you watch TYPE_OF_SPORT at all?",
  "he also studied MUSIC_GENRE.",
  "you have your own PRODUCT?",
  "you can ’ t do that!",
  "yes, it does.",
  "well, i'm glad to hear that.",
  "ok, let's go and ask.",
  "no i didnt catch that one.",
  "yes because they can play if they need to.",
  "whenever they first came out.",
  "hmmm.....that i don't know.",
  "i think it is called FAC.",
  "2005 ?",
  "60?",
  "oh i definitely think so.",
  "i'd like to look also.",
  "i understand that to be true also.",
  "that i did.",
  "i ’ m going to make sure and vote.",
  "i---i don ’ t feel like saying it",
  "i'm not familiar with him other than this PRODUCT.",
  "yes. TYPE_OF_SPORT.",
  "have you tried other BUSINESS?",
  "it has done well for him.",
  "yeah i do use PRODUCT.",
  "i didn't see it either.",
  "are you worried about anything?",
  "i've tried FOOD before but they've never worked.",
  "well, what about WORK_OF_ART?",
  "i'm wondering if that is correct.",
  "how much are they?",
  "it certainly seems to be.",
  "i'll have to google that...",
  "have you started looking yet?",
  "i wonder where you would find that.",
  "i'm a little nervous!",
  "which is good.",
  "oh, yes, but we used to do so much together.",
  "and the congress!",
  "i made sure to vote for him.",
  "i wonder how that flies there really.",
  "i didnt thats a cool fact.",
  "and yet we still have some.",
  "do i need to pay to use it?",
  "nope he is not.",
  "until now.",
  "could i get back the PRODUCT you borrowed?",
  "right and to think they are worth 2 billion.",
  "that is also surprising to hear.",
  "i did order a PRODUCT.",
  "she sounds very emotional.",
  "what happens now?",
  "that's funny you mention him.",
  "oh, that's nice.",
  "i have not clue.",
  "no. is it one of ours?",
  "it is not worth it to me.",
  "if it were not in LANGUAGE.",
  "that's kinda crazy.",
  "i haven't been shopping there, but maybe i'll try it sometime.",
  "only about five or six.",
  "is he really?",
  "hard to imagine a PRODUCT without it!",
  "i'm a FOOD",
  "how far they have come.",
  "that's hard to say.",
  "i don't know actually but when they got started in the u.s. in 1933 they were just funny.",
  "no they didn't sound better.",
  "mm, yeah, that ’ ll be great.",
  "thats wild.",
  "yes thank you you too.",
  "well done!",
  "in 1838.",
  "is this going to cost me anything?",
  "right i don't know.",
  "hmm...that's a tough call because my favorite rapper is actually a friend of one of my kids.",
  "they are!",
  "yes but it came back and bit them .",
  "she's chic, isn't she?",
  "i like many of them actually.",
  "that is so cool maybe i should check it out to see what it is all about",
  "i definitely agree and that is very impressive of him.",
  "i start next monday.",
  "you'd like it.",
  "which LOCATION have you been to?",
  "that's a big LOCATION!",
  "i am happy to say i have an i PRODUCT.",
  "why don't you drink FOOD?",
  "i don't know know that much about it.",
  "yeah and he is not even mentioned",
  "nope but it stil surrounds us.",
  "sounds peaceful to me.",
  "i wouldn't have either.",
  "just let it go.",
  "i'll think about it.",
  "they are good as well!",
  "for many.",
  "yeah i hope so.",
  "i don't doubt that at all.",
  "i would have to PRODUCT that up.",
  "let's go to BUSINESS and think of something to do then.",
  "did this just come on suddenly?",
  "oh my god!!",
  "i have never seen anyone kick it.",
  "strange but amusing i suppose.",
  "yep they did.",
  "it's not that.",
  "me either, but i ’ m dealing with it anyway.",
  "have you received any LAW?",
  "i hardly play TYPE_OF_SPORT.",
  "yes there are 750 of them.",
  "no i didn't realize that happened?",
  "i've heard something about that.",
  "not that i recall.",
  "it does sound weird.",
  "i think they're cute.",
  "i watch him on and off.",
  "yeah i think it is really cool to be honest.",
  "that is a nice ORG to start!",
  "i like live MUSIC_GENRE.",
  "it is very cool.",
  "yeah i am not sure how they get away with that.",
  "that is very odd.",
  "it doesn't surprise me.",
  "yes they are huge.",
  "i think it's crazy when you think about just how much PRODUCT they own now.",
  "i bet they are!",
  "when you eat out, do you usually eat from the FOOD?",
  "have you pressed yours",
  "i do like them",
  "keep walking and look for a tall FAC.",
  "that's really commendable.",
  "do you have a TYPE_OF_SPORT you prefer to watch?",
  "i have never tried that.",
  "yeah that's right",
  "how about ORG?",
  "probably...  you never know.",
  "i just learned that recently.",
  "i am not sure i even know who he is.",
  "yes but they played it smart.",
  "not PERSON?",
  "i sure am.",
  "well, perhaps you should have a EVENT and try to get to know them better.",
  "i'll have to read it soon.",
  "i'm majoring in LANGUAGE.",
  "quite well.",
  "that would be lovely if they would do that.",
  "just remember that in that LOCATION there ’ s nothing to do.",
  "this t. v is only $ 2500.",
  "yeah, why not.",
  "for me it is worth it.",
  "well they dont really know what that is.",
  "dang.",
  "not angry.",
  "they're probably going to be so happy.",
  "that is exactly what we're looking for.",
  "it is hard.",
  "nothing that serious.",
  "i never would of thought PERSON did ballet",
  "oh so it was a PRODUCT.",
  "it sounds like she is!",
  "i've never been, but i may start shopping there.",
  "i'm very impressed.",
  "me either really.",
  "no i didnt?",
  "ok, just checking for you...",
  "you do not have to sue.",
  "i guess that's good since they can't just take a FOOD.",
  "i've had 3 PRODUCT.",
  "that is ok sometimes.",
  "oh, i'm shocked.",
  "it absolutely does.",
  "i haven't heard.",
  "so they were even worse than usual.",
  "it has never been worn.",
  "i want to check that out.",
  "probably insidious.",
  "a friendly one.",
  "yep he was awesome!",
  "you're new at this, huh?",
  "no, that's all.",
  "they are ambitious.",
  "doesn't sound that interesting.",
  "i am not sure they would get along very well.",
  "yes, the FOOD was very delicious and i enjoyed very much.",
  "ya they aren't cheap i can tell you that.",
  "that's pretty nice",
  "yeah it is strange.",
  "i heard that it helps.",
  "you can speak LANGUAGE fluently",
  "i didnt know that!",
  "how long will it take to get my PRODUCT back?",
  "oh wow i wonder why though.",
  "that will be interesting.",
  "um... no.",
  "it was nice talking with you!",
  "he's still playing.",
  "i did watch some but there are 750 .",
  "we may travel by LOCATION.",
  "well, they are pretty new.",
  "no not at all.",
  "tell me how much it will be, and i can tell you if it's okay.",
  "do you play the PRODUCT?",
  "kind of .",
  "i should do that!",
  "they lost 6-3.",
  "i am not so sure.",
  "oh, i'm sorry.",
  "i do .",
  "yes they got complacent.",
  "not sure how he pulled that off.",
  "it is odd to ban a like PRODUCT.",
  "the PRODUCT doesn't come up at all?",
  "that is really weird.",
  "4.5 % , that's good.",
  "lol  bob ross!",
  "i don't care.",
  "here is your $ 150.",
  "you may rest assured.",
  "i do know him.",
  "i know where to get them from.",
  "that's so cool to know.",
  "oh, that's the worst.",
  "well, perhaps you're right.",
  "i'm not sure who they were.",
  "that would be interesting to find out.",
  "i've actually read that in WORK_OF_ART.",
  "i guess there was not much to do in LOCATION.",
  "that is just about right.",
  "that is terribly sad.",
  "i'm against it.",
  "that's probably good.",
  "16.",
  "im assuming so.",
  "yes he was from LOCATION.",
  "i am afraid not, darling.",
  "i didn't know that and i don't see how that is possible.",
  "i had thought that too.",
  "i think he was actually talking about the ORG there.",
  "heard what?",
  "that works well.",
  "at 7, please.",
  "it's so convenient.",
  "i thought that as well.",
  "but i thought it was.",
  "i wonder if it was in LANGUAGE.",
  "i do have a PRODUCT.",
  "it won't go in!",
  "i got an a - .",
  "do you want to study together?",
  "that's equivalent to selling FAC.",
  "yes it is truly amazing.",
  "i will open it for you right now.",
  "thats sounds about right!",
  "that's exactly what i think too.",
  "i read it",
  "that's pretty cool of him to do that.",
  "i am not sure .",
  "if we do not employ you, what are you going to do?",
  "no i have never heard of that.",
  "do you know how to speed PRODUCT?",
  "i ’ ll take three light blue PRODUCT, please.",
  "he still doesn't know that WORK_OF_ART isn't real?",
  "yes, let's do it now.",
  "will have to check that out.",
  "it's already reduced 20 % .",
  "i found that very sad.",
  "it would definitely be funny to watch.",
  "she certainly is talented.",
  "brain locker?",
  "i'm really looking forward to reading your PRODUCT.",
  "apparently most of the LAW they make are never even enacted.",
  "i always rooted for LOCATION growing up.",
  "you can say that.",
  "she kept bothering me.",
  "yep it wasn't discontinued until 2003 in LOCATION.",
  "i think he tried to be.",
  "yes, i intend to go to LOCATION.",
  "WORK_OF_ART still work.",
  "i have a BUSINESS.",
  "i'm really busy right now.",
  "that was it!",
  "that is pretty unique.",
  "some new PRODUCT.",
  "you don ’ t love me?",
  "i bet those PRODUCT were made to last.",
  "well it means that they offer everything from a to z",
  "LOCATION 51!",
  "well i would hope the EVENT wouldn't be so bad i would need them!",
  "you almost made me spit out my FOOD.",
  "i'm going to be a OCCUPATION.",
  "let's think about this.",
  "i am ready i am going to get, let's start!",
  "as you may recall it wasn't on 24/7.",
  "while i am not as passionate about it as some.",
  "i'm sure they protected him on set as best they could.",
  "well, really!",
  "it seems that you don't like him.",
  "uh... yeah..",
  "that seems alright.",
  "ok, i'm with you so far.",
  "no i think it was the SPORT_TEAM not really sure about that",
  "i don't know any LANGUAGE.",
  "yep that's what i heard too.",
  "she would do well in that too.",
  "perhaps i should call her later.",
  "damn!",
  "that is true too.",
  "he's an incredibly positive(and hilarious)person and wants to project that into anything he works in.",
  "where ’ s yours at?",
  "that's really not like him.",
  "PRODUCT slower.",
  "it's almost as if this FOOD has been sitting a little too long.",
  "some of them are ok.",
  "i dont even know what you are talking about to be honest.",
  "i guess it can't be helped.",
  "yes, that's ok.i'm glad to get started.",
  "yeah, i hope so.",
  "i would try it and tell everyone it is scientifically approved.",
  "maybe i should move there!",
  "you're quite slim.",
  "it's $ 60 here.",
  "what made you decide to volunteer?",
  "no. not recently.",
  "she dropped out of LOCATION completely.",
  "i'm not sure about that one",
  "i do love WORK_OF_ART",
  "did you know the SPORTS_LEAGUE was started in 1946?",
  "awesome!",
  "both of them speak excellent LANGUAGE.",
  "no i don't think so.",
  "ok.ok.you'd better tell me what he does.",
  "i used to be.",

  "that will be great.",
  "i never would have thought that.",
  "i wonder why they call it a \"dead LANGUAGE\" when it's still known and used.",

  "well i read on the PRODUCT.",
  "i wonder why that changed.",
  "yeah, definitely!",
  "yes, i can do that.",

  "i havent seen that one yet.",
  "he's determined to run again.",

  "ok now i have just seen something interesting and wonder if you know about it.",
  "i don't use PRODUCT hardly anyways either.",
  "it could of been worse.",
  "i might have to look it up.",
  "i think that is great.",

  "yeah i think i am going to look that up.",
  "that's pretty interested.",
  "no but i remember playing with it.",
  "although.",

  "i voted for our next OCCUPATION.",
  "who is bobby fisher?",
  "i can see how they could fear that.",
  "isnt' that weird?",
  "yes i do agree with you.",
  "is that right?",
  "where have you put it?",
  "where did you buy it?",

  "yeah maybe they do.",
  "no but i definitely wish that i did.",
  "do you want me to put it on the PRODUCT, too?",
  "and is that all?",
  "i wouldn't enjoy living in LOCATION.",
  "hmm....",
  "it just means they are cheaper and not as high of a PRODUCT but i find them just fine",
  "meant to type \"make my own PRODUCT.\"",
  "is it in a good LOCATION?",
  "he must have been quite graceful.",
  "yeah they have.",
  "he deserves even more!",
  "i thought that it was but i may be wrong.",
  "ya i haven't either.",
  "i think she would have.",
  "that's kind of neat.",
  "well good he stuck with TYPE_OF_SPORT though.",
  "i stream PRODUCT.",
  "yes that's pretty creepy that he was in that WORK_OF_ART.",
  "he probably will be.",
  "very sketchy.",
  "will try",
  "PERSON a game?",
  "i dont know what to think.",
  "i know that he will.",
  "definitely, i ’ m really sorry.",
  "i didnt even know they still made floppy PRODUCT.",
  "i only use an PRODUCT.",
  "and that's why i love PRODUCT.",
  "ahh...you got what i was saying.",
  "i thought it was good.",
  "yes thank you for chatting.",
  "unfortunately, it doesn't.",
  "that would definitely be confusing!",
  "but it ’ s unfair.",
  "if you study hard, i don't see why you wouldn't.",
  "i graduated and now want to get a ba.",
  "havent read it",
  "can i PRODUCT it on?",
  "i'm told that hasn't happened since 1853.",

  "i am very excited.",
  "it is kind of scary...",
  "there is no FOOD here.",
  "ya i agree with you there.",
  "that's putting it mildly.",
  "i have not actually but heard they cannot be separated once stuck together",
  "yes, i know how to get there on my own.",

  "i don't like that.",
  "i've heard that too",
  "it ’ s right here.",
  "good talking to you",
  "i will have to look it up.",
  "i don't really listen to the PRODUCT no.",
  "and to think.",
  "i did not either.",
  "nonsense!",
  "that's great.",
  "if you are selected for the OCCUPATION, you must prepare to travel overseas frequently.",
  "god.",
  "maybe that's how they're getting it to go so fast.",
  "i'm just wondering if it's worth going to.",
  "ah. was hoping it said something about how to cure them.",
  "i wish we had that here.",
  "sorry, i am not sure.",
  "isn't that ironic?",
  "yes, i'd like to.",
  "but now WORK_OF_ART is iconic and very popular",
  "ya i'm shocked that exists.",
  "shall i right out again first?",
  "i think that's probably why he got banned.",
  "maybe it was WORK_OF_ART.",
  "interesting...do you listen to the PRODUCT?",
  "how many, madam?",
  "love game of thrones.",
  "sounds like it must be just full of FOOD.",
  "yeah i have never done it before.",
  "because i have just retired.",
  "too bad i do not speak it too.",
  "maybe all of them i hope.",
  "so are you planning on cooking it?",
  "yes, but he may be too eccentric even for you.",
  "that happens.",
  "it's very helpful.",
  "i didn't know they were performing.",
  "thank you, you are so thoughtful.",
  "yep i do PRODUCT myself.",
  "but they are a little tight, they pinch.",
  "ah yes i remember reading that.",

  "i am not sure but if we do now we have an OCCUPATION",
  "ANIMAL are my favorite also.",
  "no i have not heard of it.",
  "right and digital PRODUCT.",
  "i would've thought so too.",
  "ya exactly.",
  "he must have been so jealous!",
  "yeah i agree with you there.",
  "that would be ideal!",
  "he wasn't called OCCUPATION.",
  "are there any PRODUCT that she needs?",
  "oh, i am so sorry.",
  "do you think he's getting too old?",
  "do you have some PRODUCT?",
  "is it out?",

  "how will you be paying?",
  "okay, i'll take it.",
  "yes he was actually really smart.",
  "do you use BUSINESS at all?",
  "well they are now.",
  "i would think we would be.",
  "all the time!",
  "i think that we are not alone but the ORG really dont need to contact us.",
  "do you know why he does not do WORK_OF_ART anymore?",
  "WORK_OF_ART is quite decorated.",
  "i'm not sure on that one.",
  "yeah apparently they are both from there.",
  "you know that's right!",
  "i never took that yet.",
  "i hope it's quiet.",
  "yes i completely agree.",
  "indeed we should.",
  "so i hear.",

  "but what?",
  "wow that is impressive still though!",
  "wealthiest.",
  "i think i will look that up as well.",
  "well, what about $ 8?",
  "sounds like a good PRODUCT!",
  "yes, i've already done that, and they said they'd look for it.",
  "they won an OCCUPATION for that",
  "no i am not familiar with that.",
  "it is scary.",
  "how ironic is that?",
  "yeah until PERSON broke it.",
  "oh, i ’ m too lazy to play TYPE_OF_SPORT, and i ’ m not good at anything either.",
  "trying to close out.",
  "i would be down for that.",
  "also if you aren't careful.",
  "hmm maybe we are on to something?",
  "geeez.",
  "i think that is super cool.",
  "well yes.",
  "no, i didn ’ t.",
  "i am with you.",
  "ok, i'll take one.",
  "he really did.",
  "you want to throw me out over this?",
  "that would be pretty crazy i will have to google it!",
  "it sounds all right to me, but i will have to think about it.",
  "i already have something to wear.",
  "you're going to like him.",
  "i don't have any with me, but i think i could manage to bring a free PRODUCT home for you.",
  "i think it was as well.",
  "yes i do use PRODUCT.",
  "i'm really glad to hear that",
  "i can't imagine they are acturally comprehending.",
  "that is quite long ago.",
  "yeah i cant recall many either.",
  "no, they won't.",
  "would be a little smelly too.",
  "that is hilarious!",
  "$ 120?!",
  "i have never tried it since i do not have two.",
  "anything valuable in it?",
  "PRODUCT are masculine.",
  "i never thought of it like that.",
  "have you visited it before?",

  "im glad they changed it!",
  "you're so lucky.",
  "you can say that again.",
  "i honestly have never used it.",
  "i do listen to PRODUCT.",
  "is she still alive?",

  "im definitely not one of them.",
  "i have never used one before.",
  "yeah, i'd like to go.",
  "sometimes it is.",
  "that seems crazy to me.",
  "it's hard to watch it now.",
  "no doubt!",
  "some of it.",
  "that seems so antiquated but it was only in 1993!!!",
  "22!",
  "that PRODUCT is absolutely wonderful on you.",
  "i don't see anything wrong with it.",
  "that sounds wild indeed.",
  "my EVENT is june 14th, 1985.",

  "i didnt know that.",
  "agreed completely.",

  "i think it is actually everywhere!",
  "i love the PRODUCT as well.",
  "i ’ m very nervous.",

  "that's amazing how much he makes!",
  "it's fantastic.",
  "so, for an additional 6,000 dollars, we get twice as many WORK_OF_ART?",
  "it probably wasn't.",
  "yes, we checked out just now.",
  "yes and i think even the BUSINESS approve.",
  "why don't you start cooking then?",
  "as did i.",
  "LOCATION isn't bad.",
  "that is ok, then?",
  "it truly is fascinating and i applaud all those that learn an PRODUCT.",
  "i can't wait to see what she comes out with next.",
  "it's amazing how far-reaching the TYPE_OF_SPORT is.",
  "do you know where i get off at?",
  "i think that we should leave 10 % .",
  "yes, it's the right PRODUCT, but it weighs too much.",
  "i'm going to LOCATION.",
  "have you seen him lately?",
  "can you afford that much?",
  "PRODUCT are pretty convenient too.",
  "i've heard it doesn't exist yet but perhaps something will happen soon!",
  "wow. good for her.",
  "i guess they are.",
  "yeah, you're right.",
  "we have to.",
  "that's really interesting.",
  "yeah but i wonder if old ORG can still fit in them.",
  "yeah that is frustrating.",
  "yeah, it ’ s fair to say so.",
  "pretty good, i'd say.",
  "that was nice.",
  "oh i see interesting.",
  "where do FOOD come from?",
  "that is really insightful.",
  "the LOCATION certainly is worth visiting.",
  "i do as much as i can.",
  "do you like WORK_OF_ART?",
  "i think so but now it seems very creepy.",
  "i ought to make the most of it while i'm here, don't you think?",
  "that's the best we can do just now, i'm afraid.",
  "i think he is ok.",
  "is curious.",
  "only 20% more to go!",
  "i wonder how long that BUSINESS will stick around?",
  "that's different.",
  "PRODUCT is good because you dont have to watch.",
  "yea i never heard about that.",
  "i've never heard that either.",
  "i can help you with that.",
  "does he win mvp awards ?",
  "it's ok.i'll leave the pamphlet here.",
  "okay, okay, what do you want?",
  "how is your ORG?",
  "a, do your best, it's very important.",
  "i wonder why they created that LAW.",
  "it all connects.",
  "i like that LAW.",
  "that he does.",
  "it was good talking to you!",
  "that sounds very dangerous.",
  "huh... sure.",
  "yeah and sometimes i still see them around.",
  "no that is interesting though.",
  "i thought you said this was easy.",
  "ok, i will.",
  "i wonder how many ORG he upset doing that.",
  "it depends on how much you earned.",
  "that's some old PRODUCT!",
  "you know im not to sure who that is.",
  "thats absolutely true.",
  "they should!",
  "yeah i think i hear how you're saying 'fun'",
  "is the PRODUCT crafted well?",
  "well, uh... i ’ m still pretty busy, but...",
  "sounds kind of NORP.",
  "im not sure about that.",
  "she was right to do that.",
  "so you've been to LOCATION before.",
  "i do like to watch some tv every now and then.",
  "yeah, look how passionate they are!",
  "i guess he was a really smart OCCUPATION.",
  "you just missed one.",
  "oh yeah.",
  "which is what counts!!",
  "i agree that will prevent authoritarian NORP.",
  "oh wow that is sad.",
  "i've been to about 25 so you beat me there.",
  "you can!",
  "oh, i've heard about him before.",
  "i guess they're winning somewhere.",
  "oh cool....im not into make up",
  "have you seen how long some of them are?",
  "i will!",
  "i used to work in BUSINESS in dc.",
  "very good, need i help you?",
  "its about this OCCUPATION he seems totally normal.",
  "fortunately for you, you don't.",
  "ya that is nuts!",
  "no, that's it, thank you.",
  "i am not surprised though.",
  "that sounds so dumb.",
  "i would hope that nothing goes wrong.",
  "must have been tough being the only OCCUPATION.",
  "i heard about that too i would like to hear some of that.",
  "it very well may have been.",
  "i guess you are right.",
  "i really like ACADEMIC_DISCIPLINE.",
  "i know i could have.",
  "he is funny.",
  "you ’ re probably right.",
  "yes i am going to watch.",
  "oh, she sings too?",
  "i do like reading about.",
  "in my opinion-",
  "ok.it sounds fine.",
  "well, you are flattering me.",
  "yeah i wonder what they even looked like!",
  "yeah, is that all?",
  "about 158cm.",
  "am i?",
  "i'm sure you can find it with PRODUCT pretty easy.",
  "i'm good.",
  "yeah and perhaps more stimulating.",
  "well, we can see it for ourselves.",
  "yeah you should try it again.",
  "i'd love to help if i can.",
  "wow crazy.",
  "yeah i think i set up a PRODUCT when it first came out and never used it.",
  "we have six.",
  "i wonder what he'll name it.",
  "at least he has a great PRODUCT named after him!",
  "well i dont think they make more now though.",
  "let's go and get some FOOD.",
  "it is nice to have that now.",
  "ok.whatever you say.",
  "i should think so, too!",
  "if i could take that to where i wanted to go and get there safe.",
  "he sure made catchy MUSIC_GENRE.",
  "i'll remember that.",
  "don't live close enough to one to shop in a whole FOOD.",
  "it's interesting that PRODUCT was started back in 2004 though.",
  "i guess they could.",
  "ok i'll check it out!",
  "you are exactly right.",
  "you think it's better that he should be told?",
  "i'm six four.",
  "i wonder how one goes about backing up the entire PRODUCT.",
  "now that really would be funny!",
  "i remember that one.",
  "yep exactly.",
  "i am okay.",
  "i don ’ t have one.",
  "i'm not sure if there should be a EVENT.",
  "sounds like he will be a free OCCUPATION",
  "stones?",
  "i have two ANIMAL.",
  "must not have translated well across the LOCATION.",
  "i remember that now.",
  "yeah i totally agree with you there!",
  "they must be good at making them!",
  "they just couldn't recreate that originial WORK_OF_ART.",
  "and they are becoming so global.",
  "that is very interesting.",
  "was it a very old FAC?",
  "im ready.",
  "almost as many as there are WORK_OF_ART!",
  "really interesting.",
  "it was always complicated to think of that when it was a LOCATION.",
  "no they don't!",
  "i bet too.",
  "omg!!",
  "yes, here's my id PRODUCT.",
  "no, that'll do it for now.",
  "because they are a weird NORP and don't believe in owning anything that is alive",
  "it didnt save me much.",
  "yes our OCCUPATION is unique.",
  "would you kindly spell it for me?",
  "that was my second EVENT.",
  "i have worked on about every PRODUCT that is out right now.",
  "well i was watching it",
  "sometime i read comic WORK_OF_ART also.",
  "could be...",
  "doesn't seem safe to me.",
  "that was quick.",
  "that's what i've read.",
  "that must have been stressful.",
  "ok.i will take it as well.",
  "it ’ s on the first FAC.",
  "i hope he ’ ll be all right.",
  "ok, we will try it.",
  "sounds like he is pretty cute.",
  "wow i thought it was the who.",
  "they should have then listed on their PRODUCT.",
  "wow that doesn't seem very fun.",
  "even though i knew of him.",
  "i didn't know PERSON played the sax!",
  "i wonder why?",
  "yes and strangely he was not even mentioned in it",
  "yeah they are so comfortable.",
  "oh. didn't know that.",
  "as much as we can.",
  "whenever i go to LOCATION, i get really excited.",
  "no i have not because i do not know how to either.",
  "um yeah.",
  "picture this.",
  "thank you, i'm coming down now.",
  "so smart.",
  "i am really into OCCUPATION.",
  "sky worth.",
  "i have heard of it but never tried it.",
  "that's really odd.",
  "oh, sorry to bother you.",
  "i just played PRODUCT.",
  "hmm i am not sure if i have heard of him actually",
  "we are also interesting and unique.",
  "no i haven't heard about that.",
  "maybe he will.",
  "loved WORK_OF_ART.",
  "i didn't get to watch it.",
  "i know LOCATION is still one of the best.",
  "i am surprised it has not been longer.",
  "altogether you have to pay $ 800.",
  "that does seem a little weird.",
  "how long would you like us to keep it?",
  "i would do it too.",
  "yes, i am seven.",
  "it must be very demanding.",
  "it was funny right.",
  "you can do some TYPE_OF_SPORT.",
  "i suppose you're right.",
  "i'm sure it's lovely.",
  "yeah that would ruin the EVENT for anyone.",
  "i don't watch TYPE_OF_SPORT often enough.",
  "and yet here in LOCATION.",
  "i didn't know that much about him.",
  "you could be right about that.",
  "well he is one of them i think.",
  "we will keep and return it later.",
  "do",
  "they must have been.",
  "it will show in your PRODUCT straight away.",
  "i wouldn't invest in them.",
  "not really though sometimes i find myself singing along.",
  "i mean sure...",
  "not sure how true it is.",
  "not necessary.",
  "i'm actually not sure.",
  "that's just weird...",
  "at 11.30.",
  "ever watch 3rd rock from the sun?",
  "maybe the PRODUCT was more relatable there.",
  "i don't really listen to their MUSIC_GENRE.",
  "oh nice good to now.",
  "yeah i think i read about that back when he said it.",
  "yeah very historic.",
  "i do follow them.",
  "he knows who i am.",
  "i knew that from before.",
  "i would for sure.",
  "really cool indeed.",
  "i ’ m looking forward to reading that.",
  "good OCCUPATION.",
  "i wonder who stays in it.",
  "no?",
  "yeah i wonder why it is not around anymore.",
  "i wonder what they have in there.",
  "yeah he was a great OCCUPATION.",
  "yeah that was before he became a famous ACADEMIC_DISCIPLINE",
  "we havnt seen it yet.",
  "i hope that what they had to say was mostly good!",
  "i've seen 2 out of the 4.",
  "thats a great NORP.",
  "$ 10 a PRODUCT.",
  "do you like MUSIC_GENRE?",
  "that is fine.",
  "i know that is unreal.",
  "in those LOCATION.",
  "i don't know the PRODUCT.",
  "obviously, it depends on what i ’ m cooking.",
  "thank you for you help.",
  "i follow them some.",
  "ok.i know.",
  "i didnt hear about him.",
  "i guess yeah.",
  "that seems odd...",
  "i guess they did that so as not to scare him maybe.",
  "wow that is quite something.",
  "that should be must-see tv if it works!",
  "oh wow so that is how he got that good?",
  "i agree for both mj and BUSINESS",
  "it really does, i can't wait.",
  "hopefully it does.",
  "i never knew that existed!",
  "that's exactly how i feel.",
  "i love to fish.",
  "and they can deal with everything?",
  "let me see... it's $ 50.",
  "wow bet he's kicking himself about that.",
  "i've always liked it.",
  "you are crazy.",
  "i will have to check it out then.",
  "and get this.",
  "oh, no, it won't.",
  "well not really.",
  "it truly is amazing.",
  "many BUSINESS didn't want them.",
  "yes they certainly have.",
  "it's nice of you to say so.",
  "i would have thought they would go with someone a little less controversial.",
  "he must have been really bored too.",
  "he is a gifted WORK_OF_ART.",
  "that's my ACADEMIC_DISCIPLINE.",
  "then you pretended to go without buying it?",
  "have a EVENT",
  "this is mr. PERSON.",
  "thats very patriotic of them!",
  "i didnt know that they died broke.",
  "they were just injured.",
  "in the 1920's.",
  "mine are mine as well.",
  "PERSON was the best.",
  "i do not think so but there is no LAW that prevents them from playing",
  "i ’ d like to.",
  "he's fixing his PRODUCT.",
  "now this next FOOD is one of the most famous.",
  "crazy.",
  "yeah maybe so.",
  "yeah, i guess i did.",
  "thats what i thought was so funny!",
  "i'm afraid i don't know how to use your PRODUCT.",
  "that's pretty ridiculous that that exists.",
  "i bet it's unique.",
  "it just takes some getting used to.",
  "that's crazy fast.",
  "that sounds like something i need to experience!",
  "thank you for saying.",
  "that must of been pretty cool for them to do together.",
  "i think they could figure it out.",
  "frustrating.",
  "that sounds really fast.",
  "thats ok",
  "are there any other PRODUCT?",
  "here you go, miss.",
  "it'll be fine.",
  "i would like to!!",
  "that is for sure!",
  "they should've bought it.",
  "i feel bad for them if they don't.",
  "how you tried this PRODUCT?",
  "it must be something primal like that.",
  "you look very young.",
  "no i didn't but that sounds funny.",
  "yeah that seems pretty recent.",
  "oh good to know.",
  "that's very resourceful.",
  "i'm thinking about it because it's just so toxic now.",
  "no i've never heard that either.",
  "it runs fine.",
  "that ’ s very nice of you to offer.",
  "no i had never heard of that.",
  "i wonder why they would want to.",
  "ha probably not.",
  "o.k.  i guess i am surprised by that.",
  "jean chretien?",
  "isn't that complicated?",
  "i couldn't handle that.",
  "can you speed up a PRODUCT?",
  "what do you mean by this?",
  "i hadn't thought of that.",
  "i wonder how much they got paid.",
  "not the fastest.",
  "( after they entering the LOCATION )",
  "they must hurry then.",
  "no doubt i agree.",
  "sounds like a great PRODUCT right.",
  "i wonder if he chose that?",
  "i heard about that too funny!",
  "what WORK_OF_ART are you going to paint it?",
  "oh, that all sounds so good!",
  "depends upon what one reads ;)  there's some pretty racy stuff today.",
  "would it be possible to transfer them to BUSINESS?",
  "i didn't know about that either.",
  "did it get any better?",
  "yeah it does feel late.",
  "do you like some FOOD?",
  "wow i did not know.",
  "bye!",
  "hahahahaaa!",
  "i know my PRODUCT wouldn't cut it.",
  "it is fantastic visually and the WORK_OF_ART",
  "yes but that is really unfair and should not be implemented",
  "there are some.",
  "i have played it and always lose.",
  "nope they sure aren't.",
  "what was taken from you?",
  "i ’ d rather you told her.",
  "yes, everything will be cleared.",
  "never saw the ORG.",
  "i'm thinking it didn't.",
  "that's pretty awesome they did that.",
  "i do vaguely.",
  "yeah i think he's won an OCCUPATION didn't he?",
  "that would be so entertaining!",
  "yes, it is still covered by our LAW.",
  "i dont really.",
  "that is pretty cool to have had.",
  "yes and he was not even mentioned it is at all",
  "that is actually pretty scary.",
  "yeah that is how it goes sometimes.",
  "i totally agree with that.",
  "it is very worrying.",
  "at 3?!",
  "i thought it was LOCATION that was always watching...",
  "that is great!",
  "it sort of does.",
  "if you prefer wooden PRODUCT, we will provide them.",
  "no i did not!",
  "no, i'm afraid i don't.",
  "yeah they did not like it over there.",
  "yeah i've read that somewhere.",
  "it's supposed to be.",
  "we don't usually do that unless we are asked to.",
  "i think that's what i want.",
  "i'm not saying you should.",
  "it's hard to tell that the ORG is even shutdown right now.",
  "any terrible LAW?",
  "i dont really know much.",
  "can we have the LAW now?",
  "i think they started around 1960.",
  "i wonder what they do with all that deserted LOCATION there though",
  "yes they were nominated for 9 OCCUPATION once",
  "how should i do?",
  "that would freak me out!",
  "promise that you won't get angry.",
  "i think i watched some of that.",
  "she must be deaf.",
  "i can relate to that.",
  "i wonder why he would ever say that.",
  "will you be going back to LOCATION soon?",
  "yeah but many OCCUPATION would just keep going and would do what she did.",
  "yes, makes you think, doesn't it?",
  "how much antifreeze did you put in your new PRODUCT then?",
  "i just laughed out loud!",
  "that seems very fast.",
  "that's the only one though.",
  "it was indeed.",
  "i heard that was well.",
  "are you sure?",
  "no, but she exercises more than me.",
  "i was!",
  "basically, i've been working too.",
  "that sounds like a physical demanding TYPE_OF_SPORT.",
  "wonder what that all means to how we live.",
  "i think reading is great.",
  "that is so classic PRODUCT.",
  "he most love TYPE_OF_SPORT.",
  "yep that never seem to bother me.",
  "do that means anything we posted will be forever?",
  "not personally.",
  "a little i suppose.",
  "it should be fun to watch.",
  "milestones?",
  "isn't that scary!",
  "so the PRODUCT got discontinued!",
  "i'd love to visit the LOCATION in dc.",
  "i guess it could work.",
  "here is 50 PRODUCT.",
  "im sure she will eventually!",
  "no, i don't think i need to do that.",
  "tell me about some of your recent WORK_OF_ART and what you do to achieve them.",
  "that ’ s all right for my ORG.",
  "i've heard about it, but i don't really know about it.",
  "BUSINESS companies?",
  "so they worked on the same PRODUCT.",
  "just stay cool.",
  "the heart!",
  "oh wow that is so generous.",
  "moving onto LOCATION.",
  "i don't know yet.",
  "i've seen a few.",
  "i ’ ll be worried if you stay out late.",
  "i want to work somewhere i can take my ANIMAL to work.",
  "i accidentally ripped the PRODUCT.",
  "i feel like she is always on tv.",
  "i think it was a WORK_OF_ART.",
  "i love TYPE_OF_SPORT.",
  "they really are.",
  "why?",
  "is 34 old for the BUSINESS?",
  "he probably can't wait until he's 55 though.",
  "i haven't heard of him either so i'm not too sure who he even plays for.",
  "yes. sure.",
  "i am quite outgoing, i think.",
  "would you show me some?",
  "you must be lonely.",
  "oh yes that is for sure.",
  "did you see those?",
  "PERSON and richard peabody?",
  "ya it sounds like it $300 to travel across the whole LOCATION",
  "after typing a PRODUCT.",
  "no, i'm fine.",
  "i wonder how they even managed to save the entire PRODUCT.",
  "ya i don't know actually.",
  "i'm going to buy some FOOD and you cook.",
  "it will do.",
  "it can.",
  "what about these?",
  "i don ' t buy into that.",
  "that i am not sure of.",
  "they have that?",
  "i also been in LOCATION.",
  "that certainly is odd.",
  "ya that would add up fast!",
  "did you know PERSON did ballet?",
  "i did well in ORG.",
  "hmm, let me see.",
  "PERSON was my favorite.",
  "yeah:)",
  "we remain open from 9am till 8p m.",
  "wow. sounds kind of hard to get around in LOCATION.",
  "and he was a POLITICAL_PARTY wasn't he?",
  "at least he's honest.",
  "i think it is awesome.",
  "yeah isn't that pretty wild?",
  "i wish i had had one.",
  "when i was younger i think i wore some.",
  "thats fair.",
  "i'm not surprised they were cheap.",
  "but you ’ re crazy about him?",
  "i also didn't realize that BUSINESS was pretty much global and available almost everywhere.",
  "that's a very difficult LANGUAGE to learn, isn't it?",
  "hasn't it!",
  "especially back then.",
  "up until 1805.",
  "yeah. can't see it either.",
  "i wonder what PERSON thought about that.",
  "are they cheaper?",
  "that's unbelievable.",
  "yes i have heard of that also happening.",
  "one PRODUCT, coming right up.",
  "not so much",
  "i think we should hire a live ORG.",
  "indeed it would!",
  "i never knew he was that talented.",
  "i try to read as much as possible.",
  "i love to read.",
  "2781703 1.",
  "yeah it is amazing.",
  "no we don't have BUSINESS.",
  "he really can shred.",
  "that's pretty funny",
  "that's o.k.maybe his wife will spill the beans!",
  "na.",
  "it depends on where you are going.",
  "it might have.",
  "well i know that the SPORT_TEAM have won since then.",
  "well, there are many NATION, you know.",
  "yike!",
  "i don't really need five.",
  "i ’ m not happy about it, either.",
  "speaking about PRODUCT.",
  "that's good and definitely practical.",
  "it sounds good now, but i'm traditional.",
  "those PRODUCT do suit him better.",
  "yeah they are pretty cool.",
  "they work for BUSINESS.",
  "i did not know that !",
  "well, let's go and have something to drink instead.",
  "generally i agree.",
  "but i still have to tell her.",
  "no way lol.",
  "probably the LAW.",
  "only 50 million too.",
  "i am not sure about that actually.",
  "perhaps.",
  "it's okay.",
  "and yet they bid to have it there.",
  "that and it is repetitive.",
  "yeah, i remember the LOCATION.",
  "perhaps i could talk to your OCCUPATION?",
  "i like to listen to BUSINESS.",
  "yes i miss it too sometimes.",
  "you would think so...",
  "yeah, but so what!",
  "no i did not hear about that but it does not surprise me.",
  "you're so thoughtful.",
  "thank you, bye-bye.",
  "i guess i sort of get that.",
  "he is very ambitious.",
  "that is really neat!",
  "i don ’ t say that.",
  "i am really excited about this.",
  "that sounds like the LOCATION.",
  "i think there's more you need to do.",
  "wow thats really fast.",
  "i mean that is so wrong and creepy.",
  "now he's looking over here!",
  "i bet he was.",
  "i think ORG better work on it.",
  "i guess so!",
  "i bet he was really cussing when he was beat by PERSON.",
  "yeah it seems like this is not ending too well.",
  "i never heard it.",
  "it definitely is.",
  "but honey, i think you ’ re terrific.",
  "POLITICAL_PARTY are not happy with that",
  "i think you just play TYPE_OF_SPORT as normal.",
  "well, i haven't thought much about this.",
  "i got caught cheating.",
  "i would have thought of the WORK_OF_ART.",
  "i do not unfortunately.",
  "i like it too .",
  "ok.do you have it in extra PRODUCT?",
  "kinda odd since ANIMAL are normally louder and more likely to poop somewhere.",
  "he makes me sick.",
  "i think we should have something like that here too",
  "he has been gifted two ANIMAL too!",
  "so then, why don't you drive it?",
  "that ’ s true, but my OCCUPATION is very dishonest.",
  "actually, i do need to find the dishwashing PRODUCT.",
  "i would like $ 150.",
  "sounds like they are really smart.",
  "okay, sir, here you are.",
  "i feel like LOCATION should do that too.",
  "yes, please, thank you.",
  "not so well.",
  "yes i saw that as well.",
  "that's good, thank you.",
  "i think that is really funny.",
  "oh i'm sure they share them often.",
  "that was so long ago in 1992.",
  "i had not idea about that!",
  "no i never do either.",
  "that is exactly what it has become.",
  "i like voting for vp.",
  "how LOCATION is it?",
  "i think TYPE_OF_SPORT is harder than it looks.",
  "it is really scary.",
  "no, i'm from the LOCATION.",
  "i know it's contrary .",
  "and they did it back in 1936!",
  "for as secure as it's supposed to be.",
  "i think it certainly can be!",
  "that's crazy to think about!",
  "he was indeed talented.",
  "as it probably should be too.",
  "yeah that was surprising to me too.",
  "how much more do i have to pay?",
  "thank you, i ’ ll pay next then.",
  "i would like to transfer $ 200.",
  "oh nice i didn't even know he did that.",
  "and it's only going to get more advanced.",
  "i would have been.",
  "did you know they still make vinyl lp's.",
  "it sounds marvelous.",
  "i watched that.",
  "first of all, it ’ s absolutely gorgeous.",
  "agrees.",
  "and do you want the glossy or matted PRODUCT?",
  "is this to go or to eat here?",
  "do you think that you are introverted or extroverted?",
  "they were wrong indeed.",
  "then what about FOOD?",
  "speaking of him.",
  "wow i didn't know that.",
  "TYPE_OF_SPORT almost never stops.",
  "i had never heard that!",
  "no i'm not either.",
  "i don't know if i have heard him.",
  "it's really cold.",
  "he's just a super competitive OCCUPATION.",
  "that is awesome.",
  "does it bother you when you eat something really cold?",
  "ya i don't know how that works.",
  "as good as any.",
  "i am sure you're right.",
  "let's go and try now!",
  "i would rather buy them somewhere else.",
  "he can still do it.",
  "thats terrible!",
  "may i turn on the PRODUCT then?",
  "can i buy everything in the BUSINESS by it?.",
  "yeah thats true.",
  "yes i think he did some as well.",
  "yeah, i agree.",
  "all really good.",
  "i think i like TYPE_OF_SPORT the best.",
  "do you use PRODUCT often?",
  "i'm not familiar with him either.",
  "PRODUCT are awesome.",
  "i do too!!!",
  "what about this WORK_OF_ART?",
  "hmm i cannot say that i do.",
  "i definitely saw more of his WORK_OF_ART.",

  "let me see.. um.",
  "i think i must report to the ORG.",
  "that is fun.",
  "your table's ready, sir?",
  "that really is awesome!",
  "hopefully the ORG would be too disorganized to do anything bad.",
  "its amazing how far and how fast they have come.",
  "i wasn't aware of that but it doesn't surprise me.",
  "living in LOCATION seems kind of cool though.",
  "yeah they are pretty nice.",
  "i know that they are used by ORG.",
  "ok, just ignore him.",
  "i couldn't careless.",
  "with everything, with everybody, with all this!",
  "sometime only i watched it.",
  "no, but that makes me even more excited.",
  "higher PRODUCT.",
  "the dry red FOOD looks quite good.",
  "i have its a really good ORG.",
  "i would have seen the ORG.",
  "ya hopefully it sounded the same.",
  "i saw it means they cover everything from a to z. is that what you mean?",
  "ok, here are the PRODUCT.",

  "well, i'm telling you now.",
  "i would be terrified with all the WORK_OF_ART.",
  "it do look beautiful.",
  "that is really nice of BUSINESS's to make that.",
  "when did the PRODUCT start leaking?",
  "are you interested in TYPE_OF_SPORT at all?",
  "laurel and hardy!",
  "that is good to hear he changed it back.",
  "well i don't know if you did.",
  "your PRODUCT is ready.",
  "that why when we dream that PRODUCT must be turned off.",
  "yes it seems like it would not be.",
  "no.  not in LOCATION.",
  "it's hard to imagine it sounded like some of the better designed PRODUCT.",
  "it seems like they have a great ORG.",
  "where will you be staying?",
  "i've been really busy.",
  "thats probably why BUSINESS purchased it for 1.65 billion",
  "i'm not sure iv'e ever seen him.",
  "i did learn that when i designed a PRODUCT once.",
  "it's all digital now it seems.",
  "look out.",
  "i guess it works for them.",
  "oh yes i vaguely remember now.",
  "it was released in 2002 .",
  "i don't think i would enjoy that.",
  "i don ’ t know what to wear!",
  "ted.",
  "i was thinking about that.",
  "that's me too!",
  "it scares me.",
  "it might have been.",
  "no i havent been there?",
  "oh, not so bad.",
  "can you put down a $ 2,000 deposit, and i'll talk to my OCCUPATION, see what we can do.",
  "i went to that FAC.",
  "we ’ re doomed!",
  "yeah they do seem kind of random.",
  "i guess it might help.",
  "i'm not sure but in 1945.",
  "i think i would really enjoy listening to that.",
  "i would have thought.",
  "were you able to understand everything that she said?",
  "not as often as i'd like to.",
  "that's great, exactly what i need to know.",
  "i love that PRODUCT on you.",
  "wow so they think they love it more than we do!",
  "i didn't either but i'm not surprised.",
  "actually ...",
  "oh i am sure of that.",
  "because you ’ d end up spoiled rotten if i wasn ’ t.",
  "i wonder if they can repair/reuse them at all?",
  "you're welcome!",
  "i normally just listen to BUSINESS.",
  "that's really smart.",
  "lastly.",
  "i bet they are kicking themselves about that!",
  "i hadn't thought about it.",
  "yes i agree it is.",
  "no, i like being single.",
  "why do you say \" have to \" ?",
  "i dont think so.",
  "in general.",
  "that would be awesome to breathe underwater.",
  "yes, but is got angry with him too quickly.",
  "as you suggested earlier.",
  "i've read that before.",
  "that's okay.",
  "i ’ d like to order PRODUCT 17, no. 23 and no. 24.",
  "would need to be faster though i would imagine.",
  "you need to give me your id and $ 27.",
  "i never knew they were banned.",
  "that is pretty fast.",
  "( get here )",
  "even the ORG gets into it.",
  "that's what everyone says!",
  "that is so old.",
  "i learned of that recently.",
  "they are kind of unique.",
  "so not WORK_OF_ART????",
  "i can't say that i know much about them.",
  "that's pretty ironic.",
  "did you get to leave early then?",
  "i really think that's logical.",
  "i never knew he was so superstitious.",
  "how nice of them.",
  "are they safe?",
  "it could be i'm not sure.",
  "certainly, that's easy.",
  "thats really sad.",
  "i guess that OCCUPATION seems cool.",
  "i bet the ORG were sad.",
  "i think they actually passed 1000 a while ago.",
  "i completely understand.",
  "well, it looks very nice.",
  "well it's been good chatting with you.",
  "yep i wonder if they would enjoy the MUSIC_GENRE?",
  "i am uncertain.",
  "it is heavy and not convenient to take them to the LOCATION.",
  "yeah i was thinking about that.",
  "yes, that's good.",
  "i don't understand why i can't just pay you.",
  "interesting i did not know that.",
  "that's expensive.",
  "maybe i'll have to introduce them to TYPE_OF_SPORT.",
  "yes that is unfortunate.",
  "that is really concerning.",
  "totally understand - we keep it around.",
  "those ORG were very creative and resourceful back then",
  "sorry, here you go.",
  "yeah, that ’ ll be great.",
  "do you like monty python ?",
  "no i don't know who he is.",
  "jimmy hanks!",
  "it's true.",
  "i guess both of those WORK_OF_ART have been shown to be ineffectual.",
  "it comes to $ 15.",
  "i believe it makes more than TYPE_OF_SPORT.",
  "i would like to have some FOOD as well.",
  "FOOD, i think.",
  "that would've been nice.",
  "mm, let me see.",
  "i know and then you go there and you're like.",
  "yeah that was nice of them to accommodate the ORG",
  "i think probably in ACADEMIC_DISCIPLINE.",
  "yes, but it ’ s not free, you have to pay.",
  "when they first cloned a WORK_OF_ART.",
  "i didn't catch that.",
  "that's very interesting!",
  "i imagine it gets almost everything.",
  "don't be nosey.",
  "you would think that.",
  "that ’ s not enough.",
  "i think we'll get along fine.",
  "it could be interesting to see.",
  "yes, i ’ d like to do that.",
  "that would be exciting for me to watch!",
  "yes, i'm really excited.",
  "so would i.  maybe he forgot they were there?",
  "well thank you!",
  "wow i am going to go look more into this.",
  "sure, what did you want to do?",
  "this is just what i've been looking for.",
  "who would!",
  "i did on tv.",
  "i really don't know.",
  "i think that LOCATION would be my favorite.",
  "ok, we will let you know as early as possible.",
  "funny!!",
  "the PRODUCT was discontinued in 2003.",
  "maybe he should.",
  "he is very intelligent.",
  "anything you say or do might make it worse.",
  "ok.let's go",
  "that's hard to believe.",
  "that's nuts...",
  "yes, it's very interesting.",
  "i have...",
  "well i'll check it out.",
  "i bet",
  "that does sound pretty good.",
  "ok, you're right.",
  "so the BUSINESS will pay for everything?",
  "i remember all of those.",
  "i think i heard that too.",
  "i guess if it still selling you keep making it.",
  "they were from the WORK_OF_ART so pretty old and rare.",
  "no, i thought it was too dull.",
  "that's what i was thinking too.",
  "you are very modest and diligent.",
  "yes, i know what to do.",
  "was i?",
  "friday is good.",
  "that is a little scary.",
  "well, i understand that.",
  "FAC is also popular.",
  "oh i heard they made it into a LAW!",
  "i guess the ORG thought they were unfair or something?",
  "i wonder that as well.",
  "that's kind of bizarre.",
  "the first one was so iconic though.",
  "i'm from NATION.",
  "i was not speeding.",
  "yeah i guess so.",
  "i don't use it that much either to be honest.",
  "i heard that and then WORK_OF_ART broke it.",
  "that would be super cool to ride.",
  "yes, i have my own PRODUCT.",
  "i am very sorry, but i must go.",
  "i read that the BUSINESS is not doing so well.",
  "i wonder if he made them laugh.",
  "i have no FOOD right now.",
  "i didn't watch it growing up but i do now.",
  "i like the ORG.",
  "if you ’ d like, i can show you were to find it.",
  "i wonder that as well now that you mention it!",
  "i used to go when i was younger.",
  "how long are you staying here?",
  "ya NATION haven't been around for long.",
  "yes you would have to see it on BUSINESS.",
  "that's ok.i'll try anything once, but sometimes, once is enough!",
  "as an OCCUPATION.",
  "wasn't it PERSON?",
  "right it takes something so small sometimes.",
  "oh right...",
  "oh, thank you.",
  "BUSINESS earned 3.91 billion!",
  "look.",
  "i guess you could say that.",
  "it might even go viral!",
  "i believe you are correct.",
  "i am too...",
  "the SPORTS_SEASON.",
  "that would have been hilarious.",
  "i think it is just what those WORK_OF_ART do.",
  "is there something wrong?",
  "i can't imagine how they figured out how to do that.",
  "yes and after that he gets $32 million.",
  "right.:/",
  "i remember doing the same.",
  "i wonder how they do that so i can help there too.",
  "it's all yours after you sign here, please.",
  "LOCATION... turn right...",
  "i love PERSON for sure too.",
  "nice i like that too.",
  "is that when the SPORT_TEAM were founded.",
  "isn't that weird?",
  "i'm not even sure.",
  "isn ’ t it really cold there?",
  "that sounds so painful!",
  "they sound like divorced ORG.",
  "i have read it.",
  "ok, i'll try that.",
  "to be honest i did see that.",
  "you ’ re right about that.",
  "would you like another one?",
  "that's so silly!",
  "i think it would be neat to travel there.",
  "yeah there is some really good MUSIC_GENRE out there for sure.",
  "yeah that's going to be amazing.",
  "yes, it helps me to relax.",
  "i am hungry.",
  "well i couldn't blame him!",
  "thats what i understand about him.",
  "not for me.",
  "i just thought i would ask.",
  "huh!!",
  "never heard of her.",
  "i never knew that one existed.",
  "talking more about OCCUPATION.",
  "i wonder what those sound like?",
  "could be.",
  "sounds terrifying.",
  "that would be fun and entertaining.",
  "hmm, let me see...",
  "i would imagine its either free or heavily taxed.",
  "you didn't?",
  "that is how they originally started.",
  "that ’ s a nice LOCATION too.",
  "did i do it right?",
  "i enjoyed chatting as well.",
  "from 9a.m. to 5 p.m.",
  "you can always go to BUSINESS.",
  "that's weirder yet.",
  "that sounds relaxing.",
  "i'd rather have FOOD.",
  "i wonder if it was actually easier for him to concentrate?",
  "racial WORK_OF_ART at it's finest.",
  "we are having a BUSINESS now.",
  "imagine racing someone wearing those PRODUCT!",
  "have you ever read it?",
  "that is so nice.",
  "i have watched some.",
  "i mean initally no i did not.",
  "yes about 78% of them actually.",
  "did you know BUSINESS is owned by amazon?",
  "it ’ s going to come together just fine.",
  "i wonder if that is still true.",
  "i bet nobody will care about it.",
  "i absolutely agree with you.",
  "well, yes, i am.",
  "i'm having my usual.",
  "i have a PRODUCT that needs cleaning.",
  "in 2010.",
  "i dont have a ANIMAL.",
  "yeah i think he did sign with them actually.",
  "i hear it on the PRODUCT.",
  "not enough to worry about.",
  "when i finish, what should i do then?",
  "that will probably be ok.",
  "when you lived in dc.",
  "you are a NORP.",
  "better not forget that, so kill you if you don't get her something.",
  "i liked him in that too.",
  "i wonder.",
  "i do not know how to use PRODUCT.",
  "yeah, maybe you are right!",
  "its been great talking to you.",
  "the BUSINESS are doing so well there they dont need it.",
  "we probably weight less because of that though.",
  "yeah totally!",
  "yeah that is pretty good.",
  "you ’ re absolutely right.",
  "that's what i do.",
  "well apparently it is near LOCATION.",
  "why, you look pretty all right.",
  "i wonder if they liked PERSON there.",
  "am i too abrupt?",
  "i'm glad that you think so.",
  "look around.",
  "i don't really support any of the most popular POLITICAL_PARTY.",
  "that's pretty small!",
  "yeah i think you may be right about that.",
  "no i really cannot imagine that.",
  "i was just surprised that it was invented in 1700.",
  "that's like swapping ORG.",
  "if they are lucky.",
  "sometimes i wonder what PRODUCT they wear.",
  "i heard about that he is amazing!",
  "i have been transitioning more to PRODUCT personally.",
  "do you think anyone will come to my EVENT?",
  "i'm sure it would.",
  "it has expanded tremendously...",
  "yeah because they think it is funny looking",
  "i was wondering!",
  "very progressive of them.",
  "what do NATION get?",
  "is that PRODUCT even around anymore?",
  "yeah maybe you're right.",
  "or maybe not.",
  "yeah they must've not sure what they use though.",
  "they are really kicking themselves now.",
  "that sound awesome.",
  "yeah i bet he would know.",
  "do you want to go out to eat?",
  "oh, i see them.",
  "oh, that ’ s great.",
  "yeah i guess not.",
  "i guess what else could you do?",
  "they might have.",
  "what can i do next?",
  "i bet they could.",
  "it's e-a-k-i-n-s.",
  "is there any cheaper one?",
  "isn ’ t that complicated?",
  "don't think so i remember that as well.",
  "i'm sure he would insist.",
  "i actually do remember that!",
  "something weird happened there.",
  "thats one for BUSINESS.",
  "yes, you must put yourself on a FOOD.",
  "i didn't know you could exercise.",
  "maybe you should ask her what she wants for her EVENT.",
  "did it come out?",
  "i will try that one out.",
  "well... i'm going away on sunday morning.",
  "oh yes, i...",
  "he was skilled not only for TYPE_OF_SPORT it seems.",
  "and more if they have bad ACADEMIC_DISCIPLINE.",
  "yes, with a p.",
  "you are probably right on that.",
  "it's very disrespectful.",
  "i haven't seen that one... not too interested in it.",
  "then what happened?",
  "say, i like TYPE_OF_SPORT, too.",
  "i hope so because that is quite fast.",
  "wow i did now that either!",
  "that's so disappointing.",
  "who is the onion?",
  "my PRODUCT looks hideous.",
  "you are right they are!",
  "the OCCUPATION were so nice too.",
  "i can see it.",
  "he does some good.",
  "i'n not sure.",
  "i also heard that is true!",
  "hey!",
  "he would be steamed and i would be totally embarrassed.",
  "any FOOD?",
  "how about going to dance?",
  "i personally don't believe in them.",
  "that is remarkable!",
  "that is insane...",
  "i've considered that.",
  "how much is a PRODUCT?",
  "yeah that is annoying.",
  "i think that we should send one of our hr ORG to do that.",
  "it was surprising to me.",
  "you're probably right, do you intend on going to the EVENT?",
  "it looks like you're very interested in the EVENT.",
  "the personal PRODUCT, please.",
  "did you ever did that ?",
  "on a different ACADEMIC_DISCIPLINE.",
  "not sure why that is.",
  "i haven't.",
  "well, this doesn't look too serious.",
  "yes, but it's not much.",
  "i dont listen to BUSINESS.",
  "let me help you with that.",
  "yeah i guess it doesn't matter because the LOCATION won.",
  "i know and i totally agree with that.",
  "i personally don't know who made the very first PRODUCT.",
  "how often does that happen?",
  "no, no, no.",
  "sometimes i look at those wealthy ORG and i thank god",
  "it ’ s not that bad, besides it really looks nice in that LOCATION.",
  "i have and loved it too.",
  "i think £ 5 would be good.",
  "it depends.",
  "all done",
  "i don't know if he did.",
  "no i did not know",
  "i was born on january 1st, 1988.",
  "PRODUCT are nice.",

  "ya i don't know unfortunately.",
  "just bring yourself!",
  "you are welcome!",
  "it was crazy.",
  "i believe i have seen that somewhere.",
  "i'm attending ORG right now.",
  "i think they lead their ORG better.",
  "why were those banned ?",
  "did you go to LOCATION?",
  "to a disco?",
  "it paid off.",
  "is she attractive?",
  "isn't that sad about PRODUCT?",
  "well, that's something i've never heard of.",
  "how would you seat them?",
  "ah.",
  "rarely see that...",
  "he is so unskillful.",
  "i lean POLITICAL_PARTY",
  "no, you are wrong.",
  "yeah and they went as far as including it in their PRODUCT.",
  "i like to follow.",
  "yes, here you go.",
  "i dont follow TYPE_OF_SPORT much.",
  "oh, that's simple enough.",
  "oooohhh!",
  "it worked for him.",
  "doesn't sound promising.",
  "well, yes.",
  "yeah i know right.",
  "no it didn't work well at all.",
  "both were really good.",
  "im not sure",
  "now, i've got it.",
  "don ’ t be angry with me.",
  "he was hairy.",
  "i heard that.",
  "that's pretty intense.",
  "yeah i think that's how he was discovered.",
  "a pop star?",
  "i hope it has more to do with FOOD.",
  "and i hear that it keeps growing.",
  "seems like its been around longer!",
  "she must have, but let me give it to you anyway.",
  "interseting.",
  "a LAW.",
  "have you hurt yourself?",
  "bowlers?",
  "explain to me how to use it.",
  "now it's much longer.",
  "there are some weird WORK_OF_ART out there.",
  "i'm sure you are.",
  "yeah that is very cool that he is.",
  "i think you'd better bring an PRODUCT.",
  "oh geez!",
  "they did not started like that.",
  "it sure sounds like it.",
  "it is actualy very funny.",
  "oh, what's wrong with you?",
  "i do remember him!",
  "i assume they look for someone swimming in their PRODUCT?",
  "i think it cost far more than that.",
  "i would pay for that.",
  "i don't know what sounds worse.",
  "trump?",
  "i wouldn't imagine so.",
  "ya. not as much with TYPE_OF_SPORT though i don't think its that popular here.",
  "i'm in that ORG myself.",
  "it will be expensive, but we think it will be worth.",
  "that's fair though.",
  "that would be so cool to live in LOCATION!",
  "that's everything.",
  "i think i fell asleep when i watched it.",
  "rise and shine!",
  "i enjoy that as well and you are correct.",
  "he's outgoing and honest, but sometimes he's a NORP conservative.",
  "yes, that's just what i wanted.",
  "i have never gone snowboarding but always wanted to.",
  "they must have been blind.",
  "i'm not sure if that's magnetic or ACADEMIC_DISCIPLINE.",
  "it depends on how much you order",
  "also in 2010.",
  "i would be curious to know as well!",
  "that is staggering!",
  "stop beating around the bush.",
  "wow that's pretty cool.",
  "that's perfect.",
  "i did!",
  "do you watch TYPE_OF_SPORT too?",
  "i have felt that.",
  "im from LOCATION and it feels like that's what we pay sometimes.",
  "well i couldn't make them any worse.",
  "that i'm not sure of but that would be interesting.",
  "actually he did.",
  "oh that would be so cool to see them.",
  "then what do i do?",
  "not just him.",
  "that ’ s just what i want to know.",
  "i did not know that either!",
  "i definitely don't!",
  "so did you ever get to hang out with anyone famous being a dj.",
  "sure, that would be great!",
  "good gracious.",
  "sounds very interesting to say the least.",
  "it seems like something out of WORK_OF_ART honestly.",
  "i know i would.",
  "that is pretty interesting to hear.",
  "from human ACADEMIC_DISCIPLINE.",
  "i thought he only liked to listen!",
  "PERSON is not in there?",
  "sounds like false WORK_OF_ART to me.",
  "well, i bet you will love them too.",
  "mendy?",
  "suprisingly.",
  "that is insane and almost unbelievable!",
  "yep that's very impressive.",
  "that's very sad.",
  "um... and what TYPE_OF_SPORT are we talking about here?",
  "i assume they did!",
  "wouldn't that be cool?",
  "i don't like anything about it.",
  "we're happy together now.",
  "i think he has now won 6 and they've all been with the same SPORT_TEAM.",
  "about $28",
  "i saw the FAC.",
  "no, i learned by myself.",
  "i dont know i haven't seen that.",
  "how old is he?",
  "yes and he was not even mentioned in it at all",
  "you know, i saw that and it looks pretty good!",
  "well, i wanna buy some new PRODUCT.",
  "i know which PRODUCT you are talking about.",
  "ha... i am not sure.",
  "yes, madam.",
  "sounds like an interesting EVENT.",
  "i bet that too.",
  "stirred or shaken?",
  "nah, not too flashy.",
  "i want some exciting.",
  "i know i never have.",
  "yeah i'm sure that's right.",
  "that would be no doubt funny.",
  "i think we can handle that.",
  "make sure to catch it going west.",
  "have a PRODUCT or PRODUCTcil handy?",
  "is there something else you need that you can think of?",
  "that's easy to remember.",
  "ok, i understand, but what else could we do?",
  "that's ok.you can buy his songs on BUSINESS and listen to them.",
  "sometimes if i really like the ORG and it is close enough.",
  "indeed that's why i checked it out.",
  "that is really expensive!",
  "yes, you definitely will.",
  "i think you're right.",
  "13 times!",
  "yeah they sure can.",
  "yeah, me too.",
  "i've heard of LOCATION.",
  "yes, i've got that here...",
  "i remember now.",
  "that's crazy i think.",
  "that doesn't seem like that long ago.",
  "yeah seems our ORG don't strive to hard to succeed or excel.",
  "maybe that is true.",
  "no i am not familiar with them.",
  "and now she is on the other LOCATION.",
  "ya it would.",
  "yeah and they still do not do it because it looks funny.",
  "i think you are right!",
  "you are smart.",
  "is it expensive?",
  "no surprisingly enough he went on to win 4 SPORTS_EVENT.",
  "do you think he looks like PERSON?",
  "i can't image why.",
  "yes i would like to know that as well.",
  "well i am assuming that they would be rapping in LANGUAGE.",
  "ya ill have to check it out.",
  "same it would be way more dramatic!",
  "okay, that's clear enough.",
  "mostly yes.",
  "you dance beautifully.",
  "i believe the 7%.",
  "i can show you how to use it.",
  "i'd forgotten about the PRODUCT!",
  "no idea!",
  "it really would.",
  "i dont think so at least not for the $7500 he got paid originally.",
  "the FAC built back in 1908??",
  "i would think risky too.",
  "okay, let's sit over there.",
  "i enjoy PRODUCTing so much i have to speed PRODUCT to get it all done.",
  "it was PERSON.",
  "i wonder if they would just laugh when they got it?",
  "nope i don't know if we'll see that.",
  "it was pretty boring.",
  "where is my PRODUCT?",
  "that would be perfect, thank you.",
  "i've never seen that one either.",
  "do you follow any players/",
  "i wouldn't mind it.",
  "it's july 7th.",
  "i didn't realize that either.",
  "i should still tell him.",
  "ok.i will get you some right now.",
  "yes they were called PRODUCT.",
  "oh that is interesting.",
  "i've got all the PRODUCT plugged in, but it appears that i'm offline.",
  "it's comfortable, but now i'm a little tired.",
  "i think i would have to agree with her.",
  "it was not as powerful then.",
  "how about this one?",
  "in regular TYPE_OF_SPORT.",
  "2003.",
  "but you did it and did it well!",
  "have you read them?",
  "i want nothing to do with them.",
  "well LOCATION is unique.",
  "ya it was pretty cool.",
  "probably PERSON but i wont look anything about him up.",
  "yes it is shocking.",
  "i think that is happening more often.",
  "oh man atari!",
  "confiscate?",
  "shockingly no.",
  "did you know that in LOCATION.",
  "i would go to one too!",
  "what do i do to log on to the PRODUCT?",
  "that's cool of them.",
  "that one should be a good one!",
  "who was the first OCCUPATION to live there?",
  "say, why don't you come with us?",
  "actually i'm not surprised.",
  "yea.",

  "where ’ s that?",
  "honestly!",
  "yeah the PRODUCT isnt the same without dunking.",
  "nope i agree.",
  "i didn't know they added them so late.",
  "it is pretty amazing.",
  "yeah i think that is pretty insane..",
  "do you travel often?",
  "isn't that the u of ia?",
  "i vaguely remember something about that.",
  "it sounds so moving.",
  "i think they will.",
  "i grew up cooking.",
  "what about america?",
  "now that sounds boring to me",
  "do you know what made him so special ?",
  "that's exactly how i feel now.",
  "it will.",
  "yeah i did too.",
  "i think they would definitely want to air a BUSINESS that solely shows something they already own.",
  "he just handed it over?",
  "thats FOOD.",
  "that could be.",
  "everything is going great.",
  "i'm not exactly sure why they were banned.",
  "and he can move.",
  "will the PRODUCT even pop up?",
  "i thought it was only ok.",
  "that is possible.",
  "i've never read that one.",
  "hmm not sure i have heard of him.",
  "at least i ’ m the OCCUPATION who rates with her.",
  "probably LOCATION.",
  "yes i agree with you there 100%.",
  "ha interesting!",
  "i think i would like it.",
  "well you don't have to be new to be good.",
  "yeah they have been around for so long.",
  "i still like to watch it though.",
  "i don't know what would be worse.",
  "no, the OCCUPATION does this.",
  "tell me if it's still not working.",
  "it's filthy because you never wipe your PRODUCT.",
  "mm.",
  "yes they are very smart!",
  "i think everyone is.",
  "on wednesday, you are going to LOCATION.",
  "you.",
  "just fill out this PRODUCT.",
  "i like listening to them.",
  "did she tell you whether you would get the OCCUPATION?",
  "that's reasonable.",
  "that is totally something i could see happening in LOCATION.",
  "i don't see one.",
  "it would be cool to see.",
  "its very interesting.",
  "7%?",
  "haha groovy!",
  "have you got anything to declare?",
  "i might have misread that.",
  "i will check her out.",
  "im not sure what it is either",
  "no, i wasn't.",
  "that's wise.",
  "that would have been terrible.",
  "PRODUCT is classic though.",
  "his PRODUCT really stands out.",
  "i wonder what they called them.",
  "well, i am how much will that cost?",
  "i will look that up now!",
  "it has been nice chatting with you.",
  "who are you rooting for?",
  "that would be sweet.",
  "i have never heard of anything like that.",
  "ya they are.",
  "you as well stay safe!",
  "is she old or young?",
  "oh that's cool",
  "ok, that would be very nice!",
  "don't you like to know anything about BUSINESS?",
  "so i am from LOCATION.",
  "same here",
  "anytime.",
  "i'm sure they let it slip out during the EVENT.",
  "i bet they do too!",
  "it has to be one of the most sucessful BUSINESS ever.",
  "no, nothing will be kind.",
  "why is it relatively expensive?",
  "it was nice chatting!",
  "it was raining when i left LOCATION.",
  "maybe he could fund the ORG.",
  "yeah that could be cool.",
  "next you dial 9 on the PRODUCT.",
  "that is great to hear.",
  "i wonder how they calculate that.",
  "that's very cool.",
  "FOOD, please.",
  "i bet you she regrets what she ’ s done.",
  "there would be so much autotune!",
  "i wonder if he is saying that they are so good they can't find anything bad to say.",
  "straight, i think, and about average PRODUCT.",
  "surprising that they do.",
  "no i would be so mad if i were him!",
  "i think it is sexist and outdated.",
  "and your PRODUCT too.",
  "i dont know if he did.",
  "i'll appreciate it if it could be arranged.",
  "that is a powerfull PRODUCT there.",
  "i hope that too.",
  "sure, is dry white FOOD ok?",
  "yes they are actually only 2.",
  "that may be true, but i'm sure you enjoyed your FOOD.",
  "it's just what i wanted.",
  "we live way out in the LOCATION.",
  "i didn't think you'd be interested.",
  "that's clever.",
  "it's probably due to ORG not liking him personally.",
  "i wish ORG would intervene.",
  "well, it's the 10th and on the tuesday.",
  "i tell ya.",
  "sometimes i listen to it.",
  "ok.mr.",
  "no, i've tried them.",
  "he prefers to express himself by tweeting about LOCATION",
  "im going to have to PRODUCT it later.",
  "i want to visit.",
  "not that he'd claim it...",
  "i am not quite sure what a OCCUPATION is suppose to look like.",
  "you are being watched!",
  "you are very knowledgeable.",
  "i mainly play on pc",
  "they are vicious!",
  "just tell him i'll call him when i get back from LOCATION.",
  "wonder if they were just practicing ?",
  "i believe it's used in PRODUCT.",
  "i wonder how long is the SPORTS_SEASON.",
  "and yes.",
  "that's unbelievable!",
  "i'm just staying home.",
  "that's interesting too!",
  "she won a grammy?",
  "no, no!",
  "what?",
  "yes, except the personal PRODUCT.",
  "i can stand behind that.",
  "that is interesting and when i think of it.",
  "i am not too sure either.",
  "evidently.",
  "i do love reading.",
  "hmmm i do not actually.",
  "yeah, i know.",
  "when and where?",
  "it really did.",
  "engaged.",
  "isn't that funny how we do that!",
  "what i can tell you is that i voted for our next OCCUPATION.",
  "let's see.",
  "that would be awesome to see!",
  "no, there is not, as far as i know.",
  "i don't think he does but i could be wrong.",
  "i found it very disappointing.",
  "no.not that i heard.",
  "hard to argue with that.",
  "question.",
  "please do",
  "and i have to get up early, too.",
  "he probably wouldn't be too happy about it!",
  "that's truly shocking!",
  "but she always harps on me.",
  "i wonder how much they made doing that.",
  "i wonder about that too.",
  "everyone thinks that will be bad.",
  "yes he does.",
  "okay, i'll take it out front right now.",
  "well, i ’ m not too sure, actually.",
  "and you are not alone.",
  "right i would buy an LOCATION and never work again lol!",
  "that would be awesome",
  "yes, i couldn't agree with you more.",
  "no, that's it.",
  "not too sure to be honest.",
  "that explains it.",
  "so do you ever use PRODUCT?",
  "eating is important.",
  "i guess i'm adventuresome, but then i'm scared too.",
  "that would be pretty funny looking back if it was named that.",
  "yeah, that ’ s right.",
  "it is messed up.",
  "now i remember hearing about it.",
  "he does seem fun and no i didn't know that.",
  "i feel it's rather dry here.",
  "are you interested in swimming?",
  "they are entertaining but not like tv.",
  "mr. PERSON will be here very soon.",
  "do people get married young?",
  "i had heard that he played.",
  "it was actually more serious than i thought.",
  "where is he from?",
  "what TYPE_OF_SPORT do they play there?",
  "it might have been they used to be everywhere.",
  "well, now you don't have to worry about that.",
  "i really hate receiving PRODUCT.",
  "that is a great PRODUCT.",
  "i usually just drive.",
  "very cool i wonder what that sounds like?",
  "i used to be like that.",
  "that's where it is.",
  "i transferred from BUSINESS.",
  "u2 is one of my favorite ORG and i had heard about this.",
  "it's sad to see that he couldn't escape his older sister's WORK_OF_ART.",
  "madam, you know we ’ re clearing out BUSINESS now.",
  "very well, i will.",
  "that is kind of cool.",
  "i'm glad you told me.",
  "that seems ridiculous to me.",
  "that is not fair.",
  "please be careful with the PRODUCT, it's very heavy.",
  "ultimately.",
  "defiantly.",
  "sounds hilarious.",
  "thats sweet",
  "three.",
  "i did not see that.",
  "it would be more cutthroat than it is now for sure and it's bad enough already.",
  "i did not even know that is possible to do.",
  "it is also referred to as LOCATION.",
  "is that what happened?",
  "all right, i'm going to need you to fill this out.",
  "we think alike.",
  "oh, i like it.",
  "so, what did you do out there?",
  "i am amazed that it is so small.",
  "that is so amazing of them to do.",
  "maybe we can start with a WORK_OF_ART to make them legal over here as well.",
  "what \"WORK_OF_ART\" were those ?",
  "all right, we'll have it.",
  "yes just sitting there and waiting for us to find something!",
  "that is kind of scary.",
  "i would not be surprised.",
  "yes there are.",
  "thank you for appreciating it.",
  "that seems plenty to me.",
  "it is definitely possible.",
  "i mean it.",
  "i find them interesting.",
  "are you quite sure you can come next tuesday?",
  "perhaps so!",
  "i am so sorry to hear that.",
  "one in LANGUAGE, please.",
  "sure, we wouldn't miss it for anything.",
  "wow! you grew up in a LOCATION!",
  "i don't have to pay for anything?",
  "it's called o brother where art",
  "i can definitely agree with that.",
  "i will watch.",
  "no i actually don't.",
  "well, maybe just a little.",
  "i figured that!",
  "yeah but great.",
  "yes and i liked it",
  "i had all those.",
  "it's just you!",
  "you are absolutely right.",
  "yeah to help out the ORG.",
  "i've seen it before.",
  "this PRODUCT looks lovely on you, but it ’ s not very practical, is it?",
  "ok then.",
  "yes, i paid my LAW.",
  "good, that's all then.",
  "hmmm that sounds cool",
  "ok, we could look at that.",
  "i live here.",
  "i would keep it because you would be breaking our LAW.",
  "yeah and i think they should not confirm those accused either!",
  "i think i would use it too!",
  "there is?",
  "is there something wrong with your PRODUCT?",
  "i think LANGUAGE will be fine.",
  "well whatever, i'm glad you came.",
  "someone at the BUSINESS called and told me it was ready.",
  "i didnt watch that one either.",
  "it's all stored somewhere probably.",
  "maybe it is making its there up there.",
  "i know!",
  "yes, that is correct.",
  "say ' hello ' to them for me.",
  "i feel like that's not soon enough.",
  "i think wild ANIMAL are beautiful.",
  "i think that would have been something that would have worked.",
  "yes i agree you have to be very coordinated.",
  "sorry ;) what is that ?",
  "i think i read that before.",
  "yes i use PRODUCT.",
  "i don't know what a PRODUCT is either.",
  "yes probably not that long",
  "were you trying to look like WORK_OF_ART?",
  "strange because FOOD are so tasty.",
  "sounds very interesting.",
  "correct me if i am wrong.",
  "now, if you'll just sign here.",
  "i dont like that.",
  "wow that's one i would like to read.",
  "from what you have mentioned.",
  "because everyone is trying to butter him up.",
  "yeah, i got home around two.",
  "i don't watch as much as i used to.",
  "i feel sorry for them.",
  "not at all, mr zu.",
  "i go as much as i can.",
  "unfortunately no i just know that he was fined.",
  "no, i won't.",
  "i hope that continues as well.",
  "no didnt know that.",
  "i don't follow the BUSINESS at all.",
  "i didn't know that but it doesn't surprise me.",
  "i don't think i would have either.",
  "no but thinking about it i can see it now.",
  "ha, ha, ha!",
  "you're just jealous because you didn't do as well as you thought you did.",
  "oh i actually like that too.",
  "the CHAMPIONSHIP is huge.",
  "i don't feel like FOOD.",
  "i'll have to find that one.",
  "like this one?",
  "you'll soon get accustomed to it.",
  "yeah that is very surprising.",
  "that could be either good or bad.",
  "yeah i agree",
  "what is your favourite TYPE_OF_SPORT ?",
  "you should do something else.",
  "i did recently find that out!",
  "it definitely something i wasnt expecting!",
  "wow i want to experience that.",
  "why didn't you tell me?",
  "dude!!!",
  "i'm sure...",
  "they are turning out to be an impressive SPORT_TEAM.",
  "considering he donated 32.000 books.",
  "what is included in determining a person's social ACADEMIC_DISCIPLINE?",
  "i guess they need it up there.",
  "well i need to go and get some PRODUCT on.",
  "thats hard to believe yeah.",
  "no i wasn't!",
  "i tend to agree with you on that.",
  "yeah but they had asked him to and he did not",
  "i think thats great for the  LOCATION.",
  "i hate them!",
  "completely insane!",
  "no, i always cook.",
  "in TYPE_OF_SPORT you can get 1.2.",
  "besides, don't make it too loose.",
  "i didn't know they let you bring them to work.",
  "oh that is really cool!",
  "that would have been awesome!",
  "i think that was very cool of the NATION.",
  "its very shocking....",
  "yeah, i could hardly wait to see it.",
  "that's super weird.",
  "ha i agree with that.",
  "yeah i don't really know about that.",
  "then he just has to avoid FAC.",
  "that is pretty insane.",
  "that's quite steep.",
  "that must be so peaceful and quiet",
  "which LOCATION will you go to?",
  "it's so beautiful.",
  "i know that's strange how that happened.",
  "yes, i can.",
  "i think that it would be a different PRODUCT.",
  "that's how i felt about the first one.",
  "it was probably ok.",
  "that's fair.",
  "can the assistant OCCUPATION meet you instead?",
  "they can also reason better than WORK_OF_ART",
  "darned right i would!",
  "it must be a good PRODUCT.",
  "yes, he said it would be better for me and for the whole ORG.",
  "that's really kind of them.",
  "yes, sure.",
  "how lovely!",
  "what for?",
  "that is strange.",
  "i have an PRODUCT now.",
  "i don't know about it.",
  "that 70s show?",
  "ok, next?",
  "if one's available, please.",
  "i am probably hooked and don't know it.",
  "oh, yes, i'd very much like to go.",
  "i think that would be nice.",
  "yeah that is so cool of him.",
  "well, not so far from LOCATION.",
  "no i didn't know that",
  "i missed out on that one.",
  "i'm a moderate NORP.",
  "that sounds dreadful!",
  "that wasn't really the point(ref PRODUCT)",
  "kind of related.",
  "no, but she speaks LANGUAGE fluently.",
  "that's amazing",
  "maybe they would not be as strong.",
  "i'll tell him.",
  "it does seem kind of silly.",
  "so what am i allowed to check out?",
  "PERSON is really skilled.",
  "i do want to go there.",
  "i do remember watching that one!",
  "i wonder whether that's true.",
  "are you sure we weren't supposed to get off already?",
  "yeah it is actually white.",
  "that's funny",
  "that's nice of him.",
  "i wish we could lol!",
  "that is extremely scary.",
  "it is an amazing PRODUCT.",
  "i understand what you are saying.",
  "we have been taking and taking.",
  "for sure.",
  "thats hilarious.",
  "oh, that ’ s too bad.",
  "i think it's interesting.",
  "that would be pretty funny to do!",
  "that is very generous of him",
  "i don't know if i would like to schedule the SPORTS_SEASON.",
  "uh-huh.",
  "ya apparently they were banned initially.",
  "i think they are.",
  "yes, we do.",
  "thats right!",
  "i have an BUSINESS.",
  "they might.",
  "ive never seen one either.",
  "oh, i'd rather not.",
  "ya that does sound annoying.",
  "i think he could read it.",
  "confusing.",
  "i bet they could have retired after that EVENT.",
  "i bet he does too.",
  "i wonder what they did before then.",
  "just because he gets on well with everybody?",
  "you are excellent.",
  "that's where you don't speak while you read.",
  "no i did not realize that.",
  "yes, but it's LOCATION.",
  "oh, that's great!",
  "that's so ironic!",
  "it would probably be very expensive.",
  "i bet he will be.",
  "a dime?",
  "another one of his i like.",
  "nice i wonder if they can use that to make the PRODUCT safer",
  "your FOOD tastes so much better than mine.",
  "i was surprised to read about them.",
  "that is sort of surprising.",
  "wow i am not sure when it comes to WORK_OF_ART.",
  "to which are you refering?",
  "i figured you might say something like that.",
  "seems a little unethical but at least he wont be scarred by knowing about it.",
  "we ’ ll try our best, but you'd better prepare for the worst.",
  "ANIMAL are usually pretty good and smart.",
  "how about some beatles?",
  "i think it is centrally controlled.",
  "ACADEMIC_DISCIPLINE is fascinating!",
  "no, i don't need to.",
  "but what if something happened to them?",
  "she is ok",
  "yeah they sure do.",
  "i should try going out more.",
  "i'll call you.",
  "yeah i am for sure.",
  "sorry, i don't feel like playing.",
  "it is just really bad",
  "did you know that it is actually white?",
  "i prefer it to working independently.",
  "you want something to drink?",
  "$ 800.",
  "i saw that in BUSINESS!",
  "that is what ill do.",
  "stop producing PRODUCT.",
  "maybe a little of both.",
  "no that is gone for a while now.",
  "why ’ d you transfer here?",
  "but isn't it the same with PRODUCT?",
  "that would be so fun to do back then.",
  "yeah that was smart indeed.",
  "what do you need my id for?",
  "it sounds so convenient and easy to decide where to get them from now too.",
  "that is definitely long running!",
  "to each their own i suppose.",
  "thats pretty good if you get paid that much even when you lose!",
  "thank you for joining us!",
  "not funny.",
  "those WORK_OF_ART are freaking adorable.",
  "i did that is amazing!",
  "scary to think why anyone would actually do that.",
  "i get you.",
  "i never read them myself.",
  "good, i am sure it will work if you can persist.",
  "one FOOD.",
  "i ’ m going to need you to complete this PRODUCT.",
  "no, i am asking you whether you will go to see it.",
  "that would make us sound funny!",
  "at least that is a positive.",
  "because i was quite interested in ACADEMIC_DISCIPLINE then.",
  "not anymore.",
  "could you weigh these, please?",
  "ice?",
  "that's pretty awesome.",
  "nice good PRODUCT.",
  "you are right there.",
  "you are sort of romantic.",
  "it is now.",
  "i didn ’ t know it would be so big!",
  "the PRODUCT came off.",
  "i thought he would be the richest.",
  "yeah he sure is.",
  "it would probably be pretty relaxing!",
  "do you watch any other tv?",
  "i guess you(me) really do learn something new everyday!",
  "i can kind of see that.",
  "it really is and i'm sure they were!",
  "and they often hated each other.",
  "i honestly don ’ t know what else to tell you.",
  "i will get straight back to you with your FOOD.",
  "ok i will!",
  "probably they are okay",
  "do you like any PRODUCT in particular?",
  "well, okay.",
  "he was unique for sure.",
  "ORG was great.",
  "i hope he did as well.",
  "i had it when i left the FAC.",
  "it's 555-4321.",
  "i should google that to find out what it is -- i'm not even sure what kind of noises it makes.",
  "in 1932 NATIONAL beat the us 24-1.",
  "your FOOD will be brought to you momentarily.",
  "i need to get into MUSIC_GENRE.",
  "i wonder how they found this.",
  "he seems like a pretty neat OCCUPATION.",
  "that'll be $ 4. 25...",
  "he's 73?",
  "sometimes it's good, sometimes it's bad.",
  "yeah that sounds like it would be fun as well.",
  "sure, here you go.",
  "it is very upsetting and we do not seem to be stopping at all.",
  "i see, so why did you decide to leave finally?",
  "i've heard so.",
  "yes and it rolls instead or rotating around the LOCATION",
  "he was very skilled.",
  "you never heard of PRODUCT?",
  "i enjoy driving.",
  "ya i think thats what happened.",
  "does he even know how to speak LANGUAGE?",
  "i think it was before PERSON.",
  "i remember when that happened!",
  "maybe it is for the best.",
  "that's not surprising!",
  "np",
  "that would be funny and interesting indeed.",
  "i'm lucky i wasn't killed.",
  "i have and it's really sad.",
  "what did that have to do with me?",
  "yeah i wonder if that means something else in their LANGUAGE though",
  "i will try.",
  "thats pretty amazing!",
  "yeah and it's all unfortunate.",
  "can you imagine?",
  "i have never tasted that.",
  "if i recall correctly.",
  "i never had them.",
  "BUSINESS thought it was going to flop...how crazy",
  "yeah they'll try to feed us anything.",
  "yes, i will.",
  "i ride my PRODUCT.",
  "i wonder who built it.",
  "PERSON gets to play often.",
  "is the FOOD edible?",
  "it does seem like that.",
  "what do you think about it?",
  "that's true but could you just imagine",
  "partially.",
  "i think it probably has.",
  "not sure why it really mattered.",
  "is it in LOCATION?",
  "no, i prefer to play with ORG i know.",
  "they did.",
  "it is an interesting BUSINESS.",
  "i was unaware that they owned BUSINESS.",
  "ya i wonder how it would be like to see and touch one",
  "yeah, all right.",
  "that is really wild.",
  "i havent heard of that WORK_OF_ART.",
  "well, can you help me look for it?",
  "it could have changed i suppose.",
  "yeah. hate flying as well.",
  "yes, but i'm not feeling very better now.",
  "i did not know that actually.",
  "when would you like me to start teaching you?",
  "TYPE_OF_SPORT seems harder.",
  "i think that's cool.",
  "i didn't know that?",
  "yes he was 99.",
  "PRODUCT is very powerful.",
  "i admit it.",
  "i like them all as well!!",
  "how very interesting.",
  "they never participate in anything again.",
  "LOCATION is pretty small.",
  "BUSINESS....sweet.",
  "do you think he'll be like PERSON?",
  "i think it makes more honorable.",
  "it started about 2005 in february.",
  "it's very smooth.",
  "that sounds pretty trippy.",
  "i agree it's crazy.",
  "i think i missed some of it.",
  "here's a PRODUCT for you.",
  "when will we begin?",
  "ya you asked me already.",
  "it does sound like it started back then.",
  "i'm using it now.",
  "that seems excessive.",
  "oh, really, that's really something new.",
  "no i didn't hear that either.",
  "true but at least george w. bush put them back on.",
  "can you believe that he actually won?",
  "yes, i have all of them.",
  "that was strange.",
  "i don't try either but i know i couldn't.",
  "no, i have not",
  "yes that is true actually.",
  "do you watch it often?",
  "i think it would be pretty cool.",
  "doesn't mean that they shouldn't give it to them again.",
  "yes, i have my driver's LAW.",
  "that sounds very crazy.",
  "that's interesting to make that illegal!",
  "yeah and i'm tired of it.",
  "what ’ s that?",
  "little did they know when they did that to him.",
  "i think PERSON makes him the qb he is.",
  "they really underestimated that one...",
  "no, it's easy.",
  "i think it would be too.",
  "i really don't.",
  "well that's nice.",
  "same to you !",
  "yeah the LOCATION must be really different.",
  "but it's the WORK_OF_ART now.",
  "he was... how was he involved?",
  "just 54?",
  "it won't let me.",
  "tv WORK_OF_ART are great.",
  "wow you would think they speak more LANGUAGE.",
  "i guess it has to do with PRODUCT.",
  "since i am NATION.",
  "you can even point to ANIMAL where it is.",
  "i've heard the top 3 wealthiest were ORG.",
  "yes, it sure does.",
  "sometimes EVENT seem so pointless and strange.",
  "oh, he's fine.",
  "i went to get mine from BUSINESS.",
  "not sure on that.",
  "that cant be good.",
  "that is awesome though.",
  "well, maybe i can help.",
  "precisely!",
  "i think that is just at one BUSINESS.",
  "so, you must be pretty interested in ACADEMIC_DISCIPLINE then.",
  "that's good to know.",
  "good talking to you.",
  "i do like to watch BUSINESS.",
  "WORK_OF_ART from what i'm reading!",
  "what's your favorite FOOD to make?",
  "i wonder who they laughed at?",
  "well, it's sounding good!",
  "i guess after the LOCATION burned it down.",
  "yeah, that would be fine.",
  "i did learn that.",
  "yeah that is remarkable.",
  "almost all previous OCCUPATION have done so.",
  "i've never heard that before?",
  "no never seen that one.",
  "all you have to do is watch their PRODUCT and tag it",
  "so is it?",
  "no",
  "i think both.",
  "judy judy?",
  "that's strange to me also.",
  "i rooted for the a's.",
  "they choked...",
  "i will have to read it.",
  "thank you so much, i would really appreciate that.",
  "yeah i guess it was over 100 EVENT.",
  "stop, stop...",
  "oh that is interesting!",
  "oh, ok.wow!",
  "that is pretty neat though!",
  "yes, you look very nice.",
  "speaking of BUSINESS tv.",
  "i'll do that then.",
  "yeah that was pretty good too!",
  "yep and i think the ad was worth it.",
  "it ’ s only $ 5.",
  "ok, but don't forget i'm here for you, and i know how you feel.",

  "maybe they should shorten it to like PRODUCT  sounds better to me.",
  "i always wondered why they flew like that.",
  "could you look for me?",
  "the total LAW is $ 185.",
  "it was back in 2005 to be exact.",

  "we're having some ORG over.",
  "that's surprising to me.",

  "and even PERSON if i remembered right.",
  "i don't listen to the PRODUCT very much.",

  "maybe...",
  "they should ban it.",
  "oh that's cool.",

  "it is strange but kind of surprising with as long as it's been on.",
  "i don't watch them very often.",
  "oh wow that's weird",
  "i don't know, i just saw the PRODUCT and thought about how pretty it looks and how much i wanted it.",
  "i'm not sure that's true.",
  "right, i see.",

  "i never saw it.",
  "i have a PRODUCT for four available at 7",
  "well. aren't you flying to LOCATION?",
  "yes i wonder what prompted them to do that though",
  "that's actually really funny.",
  "do you recommend getting one of them?",
  "i wonder who writes those.",
  "that counts double!",
  "it must be interesting to study LANGUAGE.",
  "that would have dried them fast.",
  "yes but that makes the WORK_OF_ART even more interesting.",
  "oh good.",
  "it's saddening to realize that over 80% of the world's LOCATION have been cleared.",
  "they.",
  "not only that.",
  "i try to read when i can.",
  "yeah that would be really cool.",
  "i've heard about that one.",
  "i've been working too.",
  "that is a WORK_OF_ART we will never know.",
  "yep i'd agree with that!",
  "no, we don ’ t really care because they are all pretty good around here.",
  "perhaps they should have practiced in an empty SPORTS_VENUE first.",
  "do you like PRODUCT?",
  "do you know where they're vacationing?",
  "i value them as well.",
  "it's 626-555-1739.",
  "yes those are funny.",
  "yes, that'll be fine.",

  "that would work, but don't let it happen again.",
  "PRODUCT. (early 2000).",
  "i think everyone is addicted to their PRODUCT.",
  "you were very smart.",

  "i honestly think it looks great.",
  "did you know they are planning to colonize LOCATION.",
  "oh, yes, i like that one, but it's too heavy.",
  "yeah i would like to compare that.",
  "i wonder how they measure that though.",
  "we are done with the LAW.",
  "i'm going to change into my PRODUCT right now!",
  "i don't know..",
  "coach PERSON.",
  "well, i was walking down",
  "that is unfortunate.",

  "do you get along well with each other?",
  "it's so small.",
  "not for sure",
  "you ’ ve been very helpful.",
  "i wonder what they do with all that LOCATION though",
  "very quiet and safe.",
  "i like that better.",
  "but it still hurts.",
  "i certainly do.",
  "i wonder why they would call him that.",
  "i think we ’ ll be better off if we are apart.",
  "he is amazing.",
  "it was smart of them to create.",
  "i ’ ll just have to put up with it.",
  "yeah 80% how can that be?",
  "the EVENT starts at 8.",
  "and you as well!",
  "it was to celebrate his mom's 102 EVENT.",
  "yeah, you should have.",
  "i am fine with eating them but who butchers them?",
  "he is a really good OCCUPATION.",
  "i can't afford to.",
  "if there was no PRODUCT.",
  "i know that sounds crazy.",
  "i like the SPORT_TEAM how about you?",
  "that is really sweet.",
  "that must get expensive.",
  "i agree and i remember being impressed myself.",
  "that would be worth looking into.",
  "and now as long as you're thirteen in most LOCATION.",
  "i did not how thoughtful of him.",
  "i'm going to put on more PRODUCT, too.",
  "they wore PRODUCT.",
  "that is crazy and very eerie!",
  "they really did.",
  "ya i never knew that",
  "i can understand why.",
  "i guess that is why.",
  "i know that PERSON isnt among the wealthiest.",
  "i know it up for an EVENT.",
  "i do watch it when i can.",
  "i could not even imagine!",
  "that is cute when they do that.",
  "thank you again",
  "he definitely can.",
  "i guess that's what it ended up turning out to be!",
  "PERSON was supposed to star in it too!",
  "no but i wonder the same.",
  "it sounds addicting!",
  "theyd rather dunk.",
  "6:30.",
  "did you bow back?",
  "yes, i guess so.",
  "hmm  that is interesting.",
  "that's done.",
  "NORP seems to be in everything now.",
  "maybe you should ask him openly.",
  "it's pretty vulgar.",
  "now there isnt anything you cant get there.",
  "that's too sad.",
  "i watch a little.",
  "oh, well thank you very much.",
  "oh. wonderful.",
  "it seems they do.",
  "just so so.",
  "yeah i have seen it.",
  "oh, that sounds nice.",
  "he was probably hungry.",
  "i know, but i was so upset.",
  "do you know where MUSIC_GENRE first originated?",
  "thats very true!",
  "i wouldn't want to be pulverized by one of those!",
  "yes he definitely does.",
  "PERSON first vocal.",
  "it's made from naturally frozen FOOD.",
  "for me?",
  "thats crazy to think about.",
  "hmm i do not know.",
  "thats cool.",
  "i don't play any either.",
  "that is definitely sad and very troubling.",
  "i would be pretty lost trying to watch without it.",
  "i did too.",
  "i'd like to try them on for PRODUCT.",
  "that's crazy to imagine them together.",
  "it's easy to make a quick FOOD.",
  "it seems too risky for me though.",
  "agreed it is.",
  "i've heard of ORG before",
  "it does.",
  "well then, we are all straight.",
  "how much is the monthly PRODUCT?",
  "how about going hunting with me?",
  "wow i would have never thought.",
  "i am so impressed with the EVENT i ’ m going to vote for.",
  "ya i think you're right.",
  "not as much as i would like.",
  "i really enjoy reading.",
  "oh, it's really far from here.",
  "i heard them warming up earlier.",
  "actually not that much.",
  "yes that is creative of them .",
  "i can find the WORK_OF_ART and that's about it.",
  "that ’ s fine with me.",
  "im still surprised that PRODUCT is as big as it is.",
  "that would be terrible.",
  "listen, let's just wait until the ORG get here.",
  "those are my favorite.",
  "they can be.",
  "they are definitely tired.",
  "yes precisely.",
  "yeah, i already knew that.",
  "that is an interesting one.",
  "i'm not going to lie.",
  "yeah, and it ’ s affordable too.",
  "i bet it did.",
  "i don't know but i prefer my PRODUCT.",
  "and your PRODUCT please.",
  "it's a good WORK_OF_ART.",
  "we have to part already.",
  "i'm glad you thought of this.",
  "now, i've finished.",
  "i'm not really sure where you're seeing that.",
  "the PRODUCT is built extremely well.",
  "which is ridiculous because they are televised for like.",
  "i thought it was wrong too.",
  "please be quick.",
  "i was going to ask you who he was.",
  "it is a little PRODUCT.",
  "are you broke again?",
  "i wouldn't want to live there.",
  "do you know how many registered WORK_OF_ART are in the us.",
  "i would have too.",
  "PRODUCT is great for diy.",
  "PRODUCT are pretty important.",
  "oh i didn't!",
  "can i bring that to you on the LOCATION, or would you like it blended?",
  "maybe they used all three.",
  "like i said i have not seen it yet.",
  "perhaps in the next few WORK_OF_ART.",
  "i bet they get stolen.",
  "i probably don't use my PRODUCT near enough.",
  "if you were in LOCATION.",
  "what are you thinking about?",
  "yes, i ’ m in LOCATION.",
  "i like some of his PRODUCT.",
  "i guess i don't really understand that.",
  "i have heard that CHAMPIONSHIP started 1903.",
  "benjamin.",
  "that is too much.",
  "i want 100 PRODUCT.",
  "steamboat willy?",
  "i barely listen to the PRODUCT anymore.",
  "that is very sad to read about.",
  "it is hard to keep up with everything.",
  "i ’ m very shy.",
  "we'll eat here.",
  "yeah i guess the PRODUCT has changed and also how we view it.",
  "it all sounds very complicated.",
  "you're catching on!",

  "i heard they did that in LOCATION.",
  "seems dangerous.",
  "i want to post it to LOCATION.",
  "i'd say they were smarter.",
  "it depends on who it doing it.",
  "i guess you just have to trust or not trust a PRODUCT.",
  "if we can agree on that.",
  "he got elected even though he lost the popular EVENT.",
  "yeah i know it is massive.",
  "that is why i'm interested in why the ORG are even interested in pursuing this.",
  "i can't help shopping there.",
  "not only that!",
  "i'm not that familiar with comic WORK_OF_ART.",
  "i think most of it came from BUSINESS.",
  "and they were exceedingly rare too.",
  "no don't think he did.",
  "the NATION like the us.",
  "those working outdoors have to be extra careful as these are really dangerous ACADEMIC_DISCIPLINE.",
  "yes, please ask her to call PERSON.",

  "i'm a 93%er.",

  "it was nice talking with you :)",
  "i use PRODUCT every single day.i'm obbssed with it.",
  "yes, i see that here...",
  "well, the LOCATION is really charming.",
  "yeah that is pretty funny to me.",
  "yes that is true as well.",
  "it definitely has some ethical ACADEMIC_DISCIPLINE.",
  "that ’ s what my PRODUCT is showing.",
  "it is prominent in the LOCATION.",
  "no i haven't .",
  "yeah and strangely enough he is not even mentioned in it",
  "it definitly seems shady.",
  "what did you think about the FOOD?",
  "thats interesting i will have to look that up on the PRODUCT.",
  "i'm not quite sure about that.",
  "can i have this PRODUCT filled here?",
  "it's fashionable.",
  "er... double with PRODUCT.",

  "i'll be waiting.",
  "you'd better cool yourself down first.",
  "do you have a valid LAW?",
  "i actually have never played.",
  "i do like TYPE_OF_SPORT!",
  "and i can purchase that here?",
  "what would you do at the EVENT?",
  "i am, too!",
  "ok, i won't keep you then.",
  "i would have to check.",
  "you would like LOCATION then.",
  "i'm quite sure.",
  "which is better, here or PRODUCT?",
  "maybe it is because of the PRODUCT.",
  "i believe so too.",
  "well it used to be.",
  "yes he has.",
  "yeah what would they even be able to use.",
  "i don't think he played that many.",
  "well that depends on the PRODUCT you buy and also where you play.",
  "i think that was just when he played for the SPORT_TEAM.",
  "i think it's very strange.",
  "yep i think so.",
  "woops.",
  "she was only 14.",
  "i highly doubt it .",
  "yes i read that a while ago.",
  "that depends.",
  "i knew you would say that!",
  "as much as i love him i'm going to have to disagree with him on that one.",
  "i'm not sure how they even know that it is immortal.",
  "interesting....i am not too sure either.",
  "then, how about this?",
  "you're so right about that!",
  "i did not have one.",
  "i am a PRODUCT.",
  "that is too funny and awesome!",
  "i wonder why BUSINESS dropped it from tv?",
  "yes. also agree.",
  "a double FAC, please.",
  "that's horrible for a professional TYPE_OF_SPORT.",
  "that is peculiar.",
  "that is because it was easy to dial on a rotary PRODUCT",
  "i know PERSON is not one of them.",
  "i wonder if they are any good.",
  "its LOCATION.",
  "you will be fined.",
  "that would have been better than how it actually went.",
  "it's often windy in march.",
  "next friday.",
  "that orchestra is really talented i hear.",
  "you've been so helpful.",
  "five thirty?",
  "that was also a good PRODUCT.",
  "liverpool f.c. is my favourite.",
  "i am not surprised.",
  "that is sweet.",
  "and what should i wear?",
  "yes that was it because they thought it would otherwise lead to NORP",
  "that is so cool .",
  "i have never heard of them!",
  "i must know it without knowing it.",
  "have you been before?",
  "yes a whooping 90 000 of them .",
  "i had to do something and i was uncoordinated so i swam.",
  "especially LOCATION.",
  "yeah, i guess so.",
  "zero!",
  "i think it is.",
  "in 39 out of 50 LOCATION.",
  "wonder how long he was doing it before he got caught?",
  "it was estimated at right around 65 billion",
  "we can buy that for you.",
  "that's fine!",
  "ya i've never heard of that.",
  "have u ever been to any EVENT?",
  "it would still be stylish!",
  "i'm clear so far.",
  "it's called the PRODUCT.",
  "hard to imagine how someone invented it.",
  "hmm that is pretty awesome.",
  "me too...",
  "when i am angry and want to beat someone, you stand there and let me do what i want.",
  "that's ok.but",
  "yes he thinks that we need to eat more diverse FOOD",
  "yes, it really is.",
  "i have to get home, but i don't need all of this fancy PRODUCT, i think i'll just walk.",
  "that's funny (but i can see him doing that!)",
  "well im glad he is doing better.",
  "i usually watch around the SPORTS_SEASON.",
  "i guess they would have to be allowed to have PRODUCT to do that.",
  "i didn't know that PERSON was so rich!",
  "it's a WORK_OF_ART...",
  "wow i wonder how that is working for them.",
  "are you coughing much?",
  "ah wouldn't surprise me.",
  "that is kind of scary!",
  "is 5 pm.",
  "can you recommend me one?",
  "i guess if it isn't broke.",
  "not since i was 12.",
  "if there is anyone that deserves it.",
  "you're probably right.",
  "i cant say i am all that familiar with him.",
  "that's great!",
  "i just do not know of her.",

  "it was!",
  "i guess that depends who you speak to.",
  "how old is she?",
  "it's 2065 LOCATION.",
  "well, i'll try.",
  "he was the first OCCUPATION?",
  "yeah i think it is.",
  "i couldn't have said it any better!",
  "yeah, you can make it.",
  "isn't that upsetting!",
  "i wonder what they are made of.",
  "well if you are comfortable i don't mind.",
  "she sure is.",
  "yes we should.",
  "oh, i wish i didn ’ t have so much to carry.",
  "i dont think i have.",
  "i did not know that but if anyone would have one it's him.",
  "walk straight and turn left.",
  "$ 120.",
  "just look at the PRODUCT here.",
  "yeah not that long ago.",
  "i do not...",
  "i read that recently.",
  "that would be pretty cool actually.",
  "honey?",
  "i think i remember when they announced they were done.",
  "that seems strange.",
  "i'm not sure why they call it that.",
  "does it help much?",
  "that certainly is true.",
  "i'm going to have to look that up because i never knew that.",
  "thats understandable",
  "no, i don ’",
  "quite a few actually.",
  "i believe it was 104 billion back in 2012.",
  "you said it.",
  "how have you been getting on with your ACADEMIC_DISCIPLINE so far?",
  "i didnt mean to ruin it for you.",

  "are you finished?",
  "did you know female can play if eligible?",
  "it is crazy to think that there is something larger out there.",
  "i think thats a great did.",
  "only sometimes when i think about it, i feel very sad.",
  "oh, it's so quiet here.",
  "it ’ s always easier to say something than to do it.",
  "and are as popular as PRODUCT .",
  "i somehow missed that.",
  "yep i agree it is a very secure PRODUCT.",
  "thank you, i'll wait here.",
  "ok, anyway, let me have it.",
  "i would not care for that.",
  "i not sure.",
  "your PRODUCT never works.",
  "yes, there is one at 8: 30 a. m. that arrives at 11:35 a. m.",
  "i do have BUSINESS.",
  "i have enjoyed that recently.",
  "i know that it is white and we perceive it as yellow",
  "LANGUAGE, please.",
  "i need a new one.",
  "they definitely do at that.",
  "that doesn't sound like LOCATION at all.",
  "hm i do not know that.",
  "yeah i like her.",
  "she's always bothering me.",
  "it does sound difficult.",
  "that is a strange.",
  "it was scary at first, but after awhile, i got used to it.",
  "how do i go about that?",
  "very smart!!",
  "could be .",
  "they're totally unreliable.",
  "but he would have been less famous.",
  "that's where it'll be.",
  "did you pass it the first EVENT that you took it?",
  "how long would it take to play 90000 PRODUCT?",
  "PRODUCT are good.",
  "i didnt know that and yeah.",
  "we need to have them there at 11",
  "we do balance each other out well.",
  "ok.please fill out this PRODUCT first.",
  "b :: thank you.",
  "stop acting like this.",
  "that would be very cool to learn how to do that.",
  "i do although i am allergic to them.",

  "jack?",
  "it was simple.",
  "would you like some more FOOD?",
  "he probably hoped so.",
  "please excuse me for what i said just now.",
  "not as frequently as i used to.",
  "that's complex.",
  "yeah it really is quite remarkable.",
  "they are pretty amazing.",
  "we definitely should.",
  "it definitely did.",
  "what if i repay it early.",
  "that was great.",
  "i have PRODUCT",
  "i ’ ll just cancel it for you right now.",
  "WORK_OF_ART don't bother me that much either.",
  "if you put PERSON in there.",
  "oh, you don ’ t usually have a PRODUCT?",
  "i do have it im one of the 137 million PRODUCT.",
  "speaking of the PRODUCT.",
  "yes, she is.",
  "it is boring.",

  "i bet he isnt",
  "well, you need something to wake you up.",
  "i do like the BUSINESS",
  "i have to be there before 1700.",

  "i honestly don't",
  "i will have the latest WORK_OF_ART.",
  "it's crazy!",
  "he might.",
  "oh, that's how you see it.",

  "they're saying it was already there.",
  "i'll take two small PRODUCT and a big one.",
  "seldom.",
  "i know it.",
  "i didn't think about that.",
  "i said you are sure to like them.",
  "the PRODUCT fuels it.",
  "ah very true...",
  "i'm not sure but ORG supposedly proved it was true.",
  "maybe bb would not have handled it right.",
  "i think its located in d.c although im not completely sure abou this.",
  "must be why PRODUCT is blue.",
  "i'd like to, but i'm afraid i can't.",
  "it's not so hot as it is here.",
  "i think we're finished.",
  "i'll be honest.",
  "FOOD can get quite large.",
  "thats good..",
  "has he ever been on comedy central?",
  "who cares!",
  "i wonder if BUSINESS has sold many of them.",
  "no, i won't hear of it.",
  "this is really wonderful EVENT.",
  "oh, is that right?",
  "that is a good one.",
  "it's not what it appears.",
  "i don't know much about his MUSIC_GENRE.",

  "i might have to look that up!",
  "right you never could have predicted that!",
  "now that i think about it.",
  "so, i should choose that one?",
  "that is pretty important.",
  "you don ’ t want to eat FOOD that is high in fat.",
  "they office out of the FAC.",
  "i have to look that up later.",
  "i'll go down there as soon as i can!",
  "it's excellent.",
  "it feels all right.",
  "they probably did.",
  "well, he shouldn't be long.",
  "yep they definitely blew it.",
  "i've seen the first two.",
  "i would be really afraid of those.",
  "yes it was in LOCATION.",
  "not as much now.",
  "it means it is good to be rid of someone or something.",
  "i'm afraid you can't.",
  "certainly i can.",
  "it usually comes out about $ 40 a PRODUCT.",
  "no but that is an interesting one.",
  "i like it too",
  "that is touching!",
  "i bet they can.",
  "my dream!",
  "sounds expensive.",
  "good chat with you too.",
  "that would be pretty neat to see!",

  "i would be curious to see it.",
  "well PRODUCT keep getting better",
  "good move canada!",
  "i mean i'm from the us",
  "no, i just have this one small PRODUCT.",
  "it'll take awhile, but i'm working on it.",
  "yes...you'd wonder how that would work.",
  "well as long as they don't have a BUSINESS.",
  "i have heard of them.",
  "that looks interesting.",
  "i feel it ’ s rather dry here",
  "ingenious.",
  "how have you been?",
  "i may have een something about that on PRODUCT.",
  "excelsior!!",
  "what!",
  "hmm, that's good.",
  "how long have you been working there?",
  "it's interesting that he doesn't have any WORK_OF_ART.",
  "very interesting PRODUCT.",
  "it's sad.",
  "i have read some PRODUCT",
  "i bet they aren't too bad.",
  "very dumb.",
  "it has caused me to buy too much.",
  "i have owned a few myself.",
  "that would totally be worth it.",
  "apparently so.",
  "that is so interesting!",
  "that's pretty much the same as i've been quoted at other BUSINESS.",
  "as soon as possible.",
  "i didn't think you could get them in PRODUCT?",
  "ah ok i'll check those out.",
  "yeah like you said you can find anything on there.",
  "no. can't say that i do.",
  "ok.then i'll be expecting you.",
  "ya i did know that.",

  "did she mention anything else?",
  "no i can't dance well.",
  "i learned how to swim.",
  "let me tell you.",
  "i saw that 2 of the wealthiest are our first and second OCCUPATION.",
  "i never knew i wanted to see that until just now.",
  "do you know where you're going to get it?",
  "yeah that is interesting.",
  "that is nice they care about stray ANIMAL",
  "it seems quite easy.",
  "ok, let ’ s go then!",
  "a millionaire?",
  "same too you!",
  "shall we sign this LAW now?",
  "that's so strange to me.",
  "want to taste this FOOD?",
  "yeah it explains why they are one of the top BUSINESS now.",
  "are you also going to LOCATION?",
  "maybe so they'll consistently check him to make sure he's good to play",
  "i needed to get something really quick.",
  "i am not sure if i know him.",
  "it ’ s quite convenient.",
  "oh...why are you saw that happen",
  "no i don't know what the ORG is called.",
  "yeah i heard he sold it not just once but twice.",
  "try it and see if it works.",
  "i don't feel very good.",
  "i am glad you like it.",
  "homer is the man!",
  "no, it looks great.",
  "i'm not at all keen on this ACADEMIC_DISCIPLINE.",
  "i'll let you know.",
  "i agree with that, it just doesn't work for me.",
  "yeah kind of like PRODUCT.",
  "i'm afraid we don't.",
  "awe!",
  "yep he was.",
  "over 2 million.",
  "i cannot imagine it either.",
  "i'm pretty sure it's popular but maybe not TYPE_OF_SPORT...",
  "yes, but it's very stressful.",
  "that must have been a horrible EVENT!",
  "no..",
  "i wonder how that is possible.",
  "i never saw that.",
  "i dont think he is that good.",
  "i'm sure you'll pass it.",
  "it's pretty amazing but dooable if you understand how PRODUCT work.",
  "they probably wouldn't even need it.",
  "yep you're correct.",
  "nope i did not.",
  "NATION i can see.",
  "she is also good with LANGUAGE!",
  "ah yes, that is a great PRODUCT.",
  "i'll have to do that too - thank you!",
  "we could be the first!",
  "i'll try to read it.",
  "why was the OCCUPATION fired?",
  "superb!",
  "yes i follow NORP.",
  "yesh it would cost you about $300",
  "yes, she's free then.",
  "yes and it is sexist.",
  "i'm not actually sure to be honest.",
  "very much so!",
  "im not sure .",
  "i guess they wanted to become independent from LOCATION?",
  "yes they think it looks funny.",
  "they are crazy i agree.",
  "i'm not too familiar with PERSON.",
  "i think is a beautiful WORK_OF_ART!",
  "guess you're right.",
  "i don't think anyone saw that coming.",
  "i like bowling, but i prefer to be along with you.",
  "hello?",
  "i can get behind that.",
  "yeah that is strange that someone would promote PRODUCT and not get paid for it",
  "what would that be?",
  "are you ready to go?",
  "i don't they would ever do SPORTS_EVENT.",
  "i think i would.",
  "maybe rarely.",
  "and second...",
  "why, she's only $ 29.95.",
  "oh that is not what i have always thought.",
  "i was just thinking about that too.",
  "i read about it.",
  "go that yes",
  "that PRODUCT was so cool!",
  "agreed he was.",
  "no, maybe they're not.",
  "very well too, thank you very much.",
  "i used to play when younger",
  "ah interesting ok i can see how that is useful.",
  "i would not play because it would be boring.",
  "the LOCATION are indestructible.",
  "i can't imagine that.",
  "ah i haven't met one yet.",
  "yes, he did.",
  "where shall we sit?",
  "i guess that he would like that.",
  "it seems like we would have heard about that.",
  "i insist.",
  "you can do it right now, if you ’ d like.",
  "the PRODUCT is a crafty one.",
  "they probably edited those PRODUCT out huh.",
  "i forget who that was.",
  "thats so sad.",
  "then he should donate as well.",
  "i heard about that!",
  "that is so weird.",
  "can you ride a ANIMAL?",
  "but it's said that you dance wonderfully well.",
  "i think that if they are not currently under an exclusive LAW they can be traded.",
  "we'll have to get you to a ORG.",
  "that is funny",
  "not very long.",
  "i am surprised it is going to be solar powered.",
  "and he's also quite handsome.",
  "these PRODUCT are interesting.",
  "i can't say that i've heard of him.",
  "yes, let's go.",
  "plus 32 PRODUCT when he hits 55!",
  "it's nice talking to you.",
  "you aren't fat.",
  "yeah i am on it",
  "i did not know that-",
  "wow....that would never fly in the us>",
  "no, it is easy.",
  "i'm surprised.",
  "plus it's a PRODUCT that anyone can play.",
  "ok.let me see where to start.",
  "well, he sure was lucky.",
  "you shouldn't take it too seriously.",
  "i can get a few of them right away, but might have to order some.",
  "i'm sure he does.",
  "she must be a WORK_OF_ART!",
  "well, let me check.",
  "he would definetely win an OCCUPATION.",
  "i am although i am considering tapering off some.",
  "i know what you mean, i've thought about that myself.",
  "you're so old-fashioned.",
  "thats pretty neat.",
  "what about the EVENT itself?",
  "not outside of the us.",
  "they produced knock off legos too!",
  "i am sure they are good.",
  "it is really helpful.",
  "eh, well, madam, as you know we are closing.",
  "what are you not good at?",
  "looks like he won't show up.",
  "i want it to be special.",
  "ok, ok, one by one, please!",
  "this is the first i heard of him.",
  "i enjoyed it too!",
  "ya that does sound big.",
  "what are you going to do?",
  "it's just one FAC.",
  "yes, that's her.",
  "that sounds smart... but kind of boring.",
  "ok why don ’ t you order the braised FOOD then?",
  "can you think of anything else?",
  "i don't know how to play PRODUCT.",
  "that would be kind of creepy to hear!",
  "yeah not sure why they still make them.",
  "that is so cool and different and also more environmentally friendly.",
  "...but i love driving by myself... don't you ?",
  "they both use a PRODUCT.",
  "that would be hard to pass up also.",
  "7 is fine with me.",
  "i played when i was younger.",
  "and then later everyone eats the FOOD?",
  "i'll see you at the FAC at 12 thirty p. m.",
  "heard about that.",
  "so do subscribe to BUSINESS?",
  "i teach LANGUAGE.",
  "nope never seen it i just know she was famous.",
  "he has been quite generous.",
  "i guess because he used it so much and he was so good at it.",
  "yeah that would be really interesting to know.",
  "yea .",
  "you know those ORG.",
  "i used to play the PRODUCT.",
  "he's very different.",
  "i can't dance to it.",
  "that's pretty creative.",
  "i honestly don't remember.",
  "i dont know if it is or not.",
  "not sure.",
  "i think the us wore that PRODUCT.",
  "yes i have one PRODUCT from like the 90's that i dont wear",
  "you could play it on the PRODUCT.",
  "what do you mean you already voted?",
  "ok, i'd like to say that i've really enjoyed working with you.",
  "they are very intelligent.",
  "she evidently thought she was auditioning for WORK_OF_ART.",
  "$ 200 will be fine.",
  "how do i apply for that OCCUPATION?!",
  "nah, i wouldn't worry about that.",
  "who isn't??",
  "it's definitely different now.",
  "yeah i've heard about it.",
  "i did know.",
  "i believe it was declined.",
  "you can't miss it.",
  "okay, i think i understand.",
  "that seems very simple and well.",
  "i didn't know that either!",
  "that should be interesting!",
  "when did you go there?",
  "i think they can.",
  "that is what i was thinking.",
  "you're pretty good!",
  "i do enjoy mini TYPE_OF_SPORT.",
  "i think overall this is one of the best PRODUCT.",
  "wonder what that does.",
  "i like to watch the BUSINESS.",
  "so this would be your first PRODUCT?",
  "i don't because i get very jumpy.",
  "you sound about right.",
  "not really anything interesting going?",
  "that's coincident 。",
  "bambi?",
  "ya i like them as well.",
  "yeah they are all pretty great though.",
  "at two thirty.",
  "yep he's all over PRODUCT.",
  "i could understand that.",
  "it is too outdated.",
  "PRODUCT 162.",
  "very i wouldn't mind watching them perform it but since it was in 1992 i doubt they are still around.",
  "i was thinking they were.",
  "how long ago was that?",
  "that sounds terrific.",
  "so the red and blue WORK_OF_ART.",
  "i try not to.",
  "no, i don't know what that is.",
  "i dont know if that would be better.",
  "yes, that's for the ORG.",
  "i would rather have a ANIMAL.",
  "i guess i'll get rich somehow.",
  "they also live together!",
  "then who were they?",
  "yes it was PERSON .",

  "are you sure you're not reading too much into what he said?",
  "it's been a while for me too.",
  "thats very cool.",
  "i ’ m not sure what LAW are being voted on.",
  "that's awesome to me.",
  "is this PRODUCT suitable for you?",

  "you know what is weird.",
  "i hear you there.",
  "so interesting i didn't know that.",
  "it would.",

  "i know i am going to be busy, but i know i can handle it.",
  "yeah he made 3 million.",
  "will do!",
  "i'm hesitant to say it",
  "its a tough TYPE_OF_SPORT to play indeed.",
  "that had to be unpleasant.",
  "basically, you just can't drive.",
  "i'm not surprised it is very popular around the LOCATION.",
  "there were many different.",
  "if she can compete at that CHAMPIONSHIP.",
  "not smart.",
  "i had heard that as well.",
  "well maybe you should watch it.",
  "well you are right.",
  "it is kind of shocking.",
  "i wonder if anyone fakes it.",

  "changing political POLITICAL_PARTY.",
  "i will bring you a larger PRODUCT.",
  "well, is there any other BUSINESS nearby?",
  "i tried before.",
  "who was the wealthiest?",
  "i cant imagine it would be anything that you couldnt solve by talking to grown ORG about it.",
  "why do you say that?",
  "how sweet!",
  "i never heard about it until now.",
  "but what if someone's still up there?",
  "i was just thinking that!",
  "probably a PRODUCT.",
  "that will be very nice.",
  "about an LOCATION inland.",
  "oh i totally would do that too.",
  "i am not sure i would either.",
  "we can but hope.",
  "you will be going LOCATION.",

  "he doesn't need it.",
  "i'd like to put it on my PRODUCT.",
  "that was a well earned OCCUPATION!",
  "how did they do that?",
  "how PRODUCT is a shuffle ipod?",
  "that is too wild.",

  "well then, where do i get it?",
  "he really worked hard.",
  "i never knew that about him.",
  "it seems that i have nothing to do, except this.",
  "what if we miss something?",
  "yes i'm sure it's natural PRODUCT.",
  "that's what i said.",
  "can i just do it here?",
  "and sadly it has mostly been by us.",
  "he's a pretty impressive OCCUPATION.",
  "exercised over and over.",
  "it was called SPORTS_LEAGUE .",
  "$3m!!!",
  "actually i did not.",
  "yes, i will be glad to mail your WORK_OF_ART.",
  "ok, see you.",
  "i would say he would wear blue.",
  "i have always enjoyed PERSON.",
  "ah maybe i have outdated PRODUCT.",

  "this is surprising given all that there is to do in LOCATION.",
  "it was kinda cool when it was new and spontaneous like  with the who.",
  "can i do anything else for you?",
  "i bet that would have been cool.",
  "that is very true.",
  "is that going to take long?",
  "it'll be good to see the both of them.",
  "i didn't know they owned BUSINESS.",
  "$3 million?",
  "LOCATION has a king?",
  "thats messed up.",
  "and matching WORK_OF_ART.",
  "you don't think so?",
  "i think i have nothing to declare.",
  "it does taste weird.",
  "unless you crashed...",
  "i never got into it.",
  "oh the simpsons.",
  "those are more fun and less bloody.",
  "oh. wait.",
  "i do not know how much it cost to make.",
  "that rarely works.",
  "yeah pretty small.",
  "wow...that's fast",
  "how much should i pay?",
  "i wouldnt care.",
  "the PRODUCT is huge now.",
  "hmmm that's kinda odd.",
  "how often do you call to them?",
  "don't be addicted to the PRODUCT.",
  "never been to LOCATION.",
  "like $50 million.",
  "BUSINESS did it in 1975.",
  "well, i am kind of broke.",
  "that is very crazy!",
  "we'll play the cd loud, is that all right?",
  "they are very compact and are designed to be used with one PRODUCT.",
  "yes they all get caught eventually.",
  "yes, quite sure.",
  "wow i myself do not rely on it as much.",
  "yes, twice now.",
  "two.",
  "that is just sad.",
  "do you know him?",
  "right it is very strange.",
  "he certainly was a talented OCCUPATION.",
  "that's a BUSINESS that i could work for!",
  "it was nice chatting with you!",
  "why do you always accuse me like that?",
  "so do i. i wonder how he did that.",
  "that's amazing.",

  "i wonder too really.",
  "it's rather bizarre that that can happen at all.",
  "it definitely does.",
  "its been nice chatting indeed.",
  "yes, we will have to dispose of them.",
  "probably the latter considering where they are now.",
  "yes, it ’ s right.",
  "i just wouldn't be comfortable.",
  "yes, that's him over there - the taller, handsome one.",
  "maybe, but i'm not sure.",
  "very crazy i always thought it was yellow but that is apparently due to atmospheric ACADEMIC_DISCIPLINE.",
  "i was scared of it too!",
  "the BUSINESS are usually fairly quick to respond.",
  "oh, you dance it so well.",
  "yes. thankfully!",
  "i know everyone has one it seems.",
  "you can get cheap PRODUCT easily.",
  "let's leave then.",
  "that sounds like a very quick FOOD.",
  "i was wondering that as well.",
  "25?",
  "i don't know much about it.",
  "would you rather stay home?",
  "maybe if i were younger.",
  "i didn't know there ever was one.",
  "i can see that WORK_OF_ART also.",
  "but not in the us.",
  "i never really thought about it.",
  "thank you for your LAW.",
  "i think you ’ re right!",
  "i have not either.",
  "i have read about that.",
  "it is so popular it makes more than most other TYPE_OF_SPORT combined!",
  "i'd like to too.",
  "the EVENT is this tuesday.",
  "since we really ever see them on tv i don't know.",
  "i usually only watch BUSINESS.",
  "i used to watch when i was younger.",
  "yeah that is pretty cool actually.",
  "that is quite old and quite rare.",
  "yeah thats usually how it goes.",
  "ya that is weird.",
  "like being supreme OCCUPATION.",
  "you probably would have.",
  "positive.",
  "that is so sweet.",
  "kids!",
  "let ’ s get back to you.",
  "i ’ ll get to work on it right away.",
  "it was fun to chat.",
  "that's just unreal.",
  "it must have been hard for him.",
  "ya that is cool.",
  "yeah and then he gets a LAW of $32 million after that",
  "that's all?",
  "yummy!",
  "yeah and it is pretty hefty.",
  "you and me are on the same PRODUCT here.",
  "it's not as bad as i thought it would be.",
  "i haven ’ t thought about it yet.",
  "ah i don't have PRODUCT",
  "i am aware of it but what happened with it?",
  "how did that happen?",
  "oh my!",
  "what were they thinking?",
  "$ 150 including the PRODUCT.",
  "i wondered about that one myself.",
  "have you turned it on?",
  "yes i do like him.",
  "the OCCUPATION wouldn't lie about that.",
  "that's beautiful.",
  "let's just get both.",
  "oh, yes, this is much better.",
  "i've never really thought about it.",
  "wait...",
  "i think she just snapped.",
  "does not...",
  "that's interesting and a little funny.",
  "same to you as well.",
  "i would also want to.",
  "ok.i'll have him come up to get you.",
  "i prefer traveling.",
  "that is a BUSINESS.",
  "i remember it being on.",
  "i would have to say it gets cold.",
  "no i would never listen to that.",
  "that might need to be updated because PERSON is the wealthiest we have ever had.",
  "then we ’ ll have to put up with it.",
  "which SPORT_TEAM is that?",
  "oh i remember those.",
  "you got what i meant.",
  "yeah i don't like him.",
  "that could be handy.",
  "yeah they purcahsed it back in 1998.",
  "what does that have to do with those ORG shooting at us?",
  "i'm 32.",
  "something about psyching the other SPORT_TEAM out if i remember right.",
  "i did not but now that you mention it i can't think of a left handed qb.",
  "i am sorry that i misheard you.",
  "are your FOOD ok?",
  "i'm using the PRODUCT.",
  "i bet they are.",
  "he coaches the SPORT_TEAM.",
  "i mean i've red that.",
  "what am i suppose to do?",
  "and how about LOCATION?",
  "you can ’ t imagine what he is like now.",
  "it was sad.",
  "i suppose that id they want to analyse more ACADEMIC_DISCIPLINE.",
  "that's something.",
  "that sure didn't last long!",
  "i haven't heard about him lately.",
  "what's that supposed to mean?",
  "yeah he is for sure.",
  "yes but i didn't know that they acquired it back in 1998!",
  "i cant imagine that.",
  "not everything, but nearly.",
  "say 201.",
  "it is sad that the SPORTS_VENUE will just sit there after though.",
  "didn't want to be associated with the POLITICAL_PARTY.",
  "are they going to be okay?",
  "i ’ ve been accepted!",
  "rats!",
  "i love them both but i think i enjoy reading more right now.",
  "by LOCATION.",
  "i believe they were.",
  "that's pretty interesting and cool.",
  "what am i going to do since i haven't received the LAW?",
  "would they rescue me.",
  "what ’ s on?",
  "and it was the SPORTS_EVENT!!",
  "wow that is really neat.",
  "the latest PRODUCT.",
  "it's valid for 5 LAW.",
  "somewhat he can be strange.",
  "since i grew up on an LOCATION.",
  "yeah that was smart.",
  "that is crazy i would not have guessed that.",
  "when i first moved in, i walked everywhere.",
  "no, i guess not.",
  "i think that is so wild.",
  "he has kind of a sad WORK_OF_ART though.",
  "how do you think he would take it knowing he's not one of the 3 wealthiest OCCUPATION",
  "fairly expensive.",
  "very well too, is there anything i can do for you?",
  "yeah that definitely does not surprise me.",
  "they are screwed if they don't.",
  "i'd actually tune in to see that PRODUCT!",
  "i like some of their MUSIC_GENRE.",
  "i've heard something about that before!",
  "you won't have to pay the LAW.",
  "that would be incredible.",
  "i can do that.",
  "where do i sign?",
  "well, that's fine.",
  "but if you are planning on bashing PRODUCT.",
  "not as much as i would like to.",
  "maybe because it was in a minor MUSIC_GENRE",
  "you're a regular PERSON!",
  "i am not really into TYPE_OF_SPORT but that does impress me.",
  "yes, hope you can enjoy it.",
  "a very tiny.",
  "it seems you've got everything done.",
  "that is what i was thinking too.",
  "you should and while your on it.",
  "why are you nervous?",
  "i don't go to EVENT.",
  "very entertaining.",
  "yeah indeed.",
  "i took something earlier.",
  "you know the WORK_OF_ART are usually better.",
  "yeah those were the other two.",
  "that is too funny.",
  "it's an PRODUCT.",
  "and you will do some traveling while you are here?",
  "ok.i will send them now.",
  "that would been interesting.",
  "it's so fascinating!",
  "if you're hungry, then cook something.",
  "i use it.",
  "no, we don't do that here.",
  "i didn't know that!",
  "i wonder if BUSINESS would publish that?",
  "well, i ’ m looking for PRODUCT 10 but you don ’ t have it.",
  "mr. : would you like to go to the ORG's?",
  "that was such a nice EVENT.",
  "that ’ s great.",
  "well, you can call it in later.",
  "i would not download the PRODUCT though.",
  "yes the ORG just couldn't resist.",
  ":)",
  "just sign right here, please.",
  "do you have anything else i can have instead?",
  "that sounds unfair!",
  "that's why ORG exists.",
  "they are smart ORG!",
  "what about these PRODUCT?",
  "and when is your EVENT?",
  "oh, please.",
  "yeah, i know that.",
  "that would be so interesting.",
  "i didnt watch.",
  "please let me check.",
  "well, they're really beautiful ORG.",
  "he must have felt so bad about that.",
  "can you spell that, please?",
  "i guess it would be easier to climb in that LOCATION though.",
  "i don'tknow.",
  "wow but she is funny!",
  "that ’ s fabulous.",
  "you are not funny either.",
  "it's snowing heavily.",
  "do you know how PRODUCT were invented?",
  "i remember thinking just about everything in the prequels' WORK_OF_ART was off.",
  "finally it got so bad i just had to find another BUSINESS to rent from.",
  "ok, see you then.",
  "im sorry to hear.",
  "oh. which three PRODUCT?",
  "i didn't what was that?",
  "i will say it again...",
  "can i just call someone myself to fix it?",
  "looks like he was pretty sick too.",
  "01705...",
  "this can't be the same ANIMAL.",
  "it's kind of similar.",
  "yeah that is right.",
  "he taught ACADEMIC_DISCIPLINE.",
  "no, what happened?",
  "i hope it is as great as i hear.",
  "sure, i'd love to.",
  "i do love PRODUCT better.",
  "my LANGUAGE isn't very good.",
  "don't know about that.",
  "i ’ d prefer FOOD.",
  "i saw that special on that.",
  "i think i read about that recently.",
  "so do you!",
  "you're right, that's not bad at all.",
  "what?!",
  "no, i don't think it could be.",
  "when he pulled out the PRODUCT, i got so scared.",
  "how much would you like?",
  "now that's funny!",
  "i'm guessing they were just made with better PRODUCT.",
  "yeah that is pretty funny looking back at it now.",
  "i'm not going to be able to fall asleep.",
  "since we live in the same LOCATION, maybe we can help each other from now on.",
  "i would suspect.",
  "it sounds kind of crazy.",
  "i am hearing about it for the first EVENT too.",
  "it did yeah.",
  "they must have been exhausted!",
  "ok, i'll take it.",
  "yeah i think they have played over 2.000 EVENT!",
  "it is LOCATION.",
  "okay, i'll get PERSON to cover you.",
  "i really don't feel like walking.",
  "michael jordan?",
  "they should donate more than that.",
  "that sounds absolutely disgusting!",
  "i did and i really enjoyed it.",
  "it would be nice to find out.",
  "it usually goes to the LOCATION.",
  "he sure was.",
  "very neat and patriotic.",
  "is that on t.v.?",
  "i'm just looking.",
  "maybe they don ’ t agree with my FOOD.",
  "we'll have to discuss it with my OCCUPATION.",
  "yes, a medium FOOD.",
  "PRODUCT do so much now.",
  "maybe you lost it before you came here.",
  "i  haven seen that before so maybe it hasnt happened.",
  "im surprised he turned down the LAW!",
  "i heard.",
  "i do not but obviously ever one is aware of it.",
  "no, it's a monday.",
  "i guess they concluded that MUSIC_GENRE has grown louder and increasingly musically homogeneous since the mid-1960s",
  "ah ok i'll check him out!",
  "what do they mean?",
  "the PRODUCT can be what it is.",
  "been great chatting with you as well!",
  "nice i wonder how they manage to do that though",
  "that was a pleasant EVENT.",
  "no. just bring yourself.",
  "yes, that's what i am looking for.",
  "i actually work here.",
  "oh, just on my own.",
  "i can't believe it took them that long to discontinue it.",
  "yeah that is interesting as well.",
  "i agree its really funny",
  "well, if you say so.",
  "that's totally unfair!!!",
  "indeed she can!",
  "i am not sure actually.",
  "that ’ s very specialized.",
  "i can't believe they would play so good.",
  "that's great, bring me a FOOD of that please.",
  "did that really happen?",
  "then let me take you out to EVENT to celebrate.",
  "it's very considerate of you to do so.",
  "i saw that it was ORG.",
  "can we adjust the PRODUCT a little?",
  "it suits us fine.",
  "i saw that too.",
  "i don't read them.",
  "more than 2000 now.",
  "i feel that the whole ORG needs to be there.",
  "that would help for sure!",
  "well, it seems we have covered everything.",
  "let's do it together.",
  "might be worth it.",
  "i have never used an PRODUCT before.",
  "i'm not sure how i feel about that.",
  "what do you usually write about?",
  "nobody could compete with him.",
  "we can do that, but you'll have to pay a little extra.",
  "yes it is very nice.",
  "i have.",
  "this PRODUCT is $ 1500.",
  "i can't imagine how hard it would be to wrestle while covered in olive FOOD!",
  "yes that is very true.",
  "personally i don't.",
  "i certainly watch tv.",
  "it was a pretty well-behaved WORK_OF_ART.",
  "that was kind of them.",
  "would you ever want to visit BUSINESS?",
  "it wasn't too bad.",
  "but that is a little risky, you know.",
  "they sure are regrettin it lol.",
  "you shouldn't drink FOOD when you're really thirsty.",
  "yes. fascinating.",
  "so funny!",
  "that does sound pretty good!",
  "it's wrong because---it isn't true.",
  "i live at no. 50 LOCATION.",
  "i personally don't want to think about it.",
  "i do not know what that is.",
  "yeah they can be like that.",
  "he is a TYPE_OF_SPORT.",
  "i watch when i can.",
  "its very dangerous.",
  "exactly, it wouldn't be nice if it started raining.",
  "i ’ ve got them there.",
  "i'll have to look into it",
  "apparently the LOCATION is 2 ft. deep?",
  "why don't you just get black?",
  "yes it would and i have wanted to learn LANGUAGE but heard it was very hard to do so.",
  "i hope so too and i really wonder if they were any good",
  "maybe you can correct it by going to a driving LOCATION before you play again.",
  "you have to be careful.",
  "yeah it's actually really good.",
  "i could see that out of PERSON.",
  "that will be all for me.",
  "i ’ ll do that for you.",
  "a, whatever you do, the most important is WORK_OF_ART.",
  "PERSON definitely should have tried that.",
  "besides, can you take up the hem one PRODUCT?",
  "yes it was good talking to you",
  "i can see that but am a little surprised that PERSON took over.",
  "i use BUSINESS the most.",
  "what do you mean it weakens TYPE_OF_SPORT?",
  "that is a little scary!",
  "you're welcome.",
  "that's right",
  "i bet there was one.",
  "i try to follow as much as i can.",
  "it looks fine.",
  "hold on, i ’ ll get her.",

  "i'm tired.",
  "ok already.",
  "im sure.",
  "but did he fumble twice?",
  "oh i agree with you.",
  "i know very little about TYPE_OF_SPORT.",
  "google?",

  "sometimes that's true, but not usually.",
  "i was surprised to hear that.",
  "goodnight",
  "actually i also cancelled PRODUCT.",
  "very beautiful and very interesting.",
  "that sounds weird.",
  "oh, i am very sorry about that.",
  "ya i agree with you.",
  "i am really good at TYPE_OF_SPORT.",
  "why do they do what?",
  "sure, what PRODUCT do you like?",
  "i wanted to see FAC.",

  "eddie perfect?",
  "so, what do you feel like eating then?",

  "well, he was very good to me.",
  "that's so convenient.",
  "interesting enough.",

  "it's a competitive TYPE_OF_SPORT.",
  "i see the WORK_OF_ART.",
  "that's why BUSINESS is great!",
  "baseball is american!",
  "ya i wanted to see if they really were that bad.",
  "so do you like the PRODUCT?",

  "you're right on that one.",
  "they are so beautiful.",
  "oh, yeah, they always get really drunk.",

  "i read about it somewhere.",
  "i think that she was so driven that she couldnt do anything but succeed.",
  "me neither unless i've been drinking.",
  "i don't think i could do that it sounds sketchy.",
  "thank you for all that you have done so patiently.",
  "one of them was george w. bush.",
  "mmm, that sounds very interesting.",
  "oh thats fun.",
  "oh, it is not so expensive.",

  "i can too!",
  "you may be correct.",
  "maybe no ORG would watch them!",
  "it's funny...",
  "how long is it valid?",
  "i am going to go try to watch.",
  "i've only been to LOCATION once.",
  "thats pretty cool!",
  "oh, yeah, while he was eating, and he was a pretty famous don.",
  "i wonder how they found that out?",
  "well, thank you very much.",
  "i don't watch very often.",
  "i'm ready.",
  "i really should.",
  "yeah.. that is awesome!",
  "oh, they all went out!",
  "how did he do that?",
  "yes i sure have and they have even won OCCUPATION.",
  "on the PRODUCT?",
  "i wonder if that is expensive for them?",
  "that has nothing to do with it...",
  "usually though BUSINESS.",
  "that sounds really stupid to me.",
  "i forgot to bring that with me.",
  "i wonder how they sound.",
  "i think that could be very useful.",
  "i skim it.",
  "no, this is 2517759.",
  "isn't that wacky!",
  "i bet it is even more now.",
  "no, i am from LOCATION.",
  "i don't know how they did it.",
  "how much are you talking?",
  "they are sure a ORG for sure.",
  "i have been to the ORG.",
  "could be at that.",
  "yes that is very historic.",
  "is it true or isn ’ t it?",
  "yeah those old PRODUCT and you have to jimmy it just right.",
  "when there is a disputed LOCATION.",
  "now they are apparently worth 1.8 billion although i wouldn't be surprised to see that go up.",
  "and look out she's dressed.",
  "less than TYPE_OF_SPORT.",
  "that would be really interesting.",
  "strange as it seems.",
  "not until recently.",
  "i love WORK_OF_ART.",
  "i'm sure you didn't.",
  "i thought a LOCATION was for studying.",
  "nice. good for him.",
  "i think i have read that.",
  "she sure can.",
  "he's a OCCUPATION.",
  "i'd be happy to write one for you.",
  "right and it would have only costed 50 million.",
  "very noble indeed.",
  "i wonder how he got around LOCATION.",
  "yeah that is kind of interesting.",
  "i think it might be horrible though.",
  "dr house!",
  "i wonder how that worked?",
  "it is impressive",
  "wow i never would have thought that.",
  "did someone get hurt?",
  "lisa?",
  "i would have loved to seen that with PERSON.",
  "oh that is different.",
  "i miss TYPE_OF_SPORT.",
  "especially between 9p-PRODUCT.",
  "did you know that from 9 pm to 12 am.",
  "wow i didn't know that about LOCATION.",
  "no. not worried...",
  "oh wow that is really neat!",
  "that ' s a good one!",
  "it must have.",
  "long as they're not in LOCATION.",
  "that sounds very good.",
  "that's very nice.",
  "i find that interesting.",
  "then what?",
  "you have got to be talented.",
  "well, then, would you send it to LOCATION, please?",
  "we would love to sit outside.",
  "that is a little surprising.",
  "fine, then!",
  "nine-thirty.",
  "how do you like PRODUCT?",
  "it's 212-331-7600.",
  "wen!",
  "no i did not see it.",
  "it was really different!",
  "it just depends.",
  "i havn't seen her for a while.",
  "i've heard that it's more accurate than any other PRODUCT to shoot.",
  "only 3g though.",
  "why them?",
  "you're too strict with yourself.",
  "i used to contribute to that bandwidth PRODUCT.",
  "be seeing you then.",
  "have you thought about going in LANGUAGE?",
  "how much will it hurt?",
  "yeah i can't see him as a super WORK_OF_ART",
  "four PRODUCT is enough.",
  "it's getting so expensive to travel there.",
  "its called FAC.",
  "i was a wee one",
  "better than the ORG.",
  "yeah i use it almost everyday.",
  "i will never go out with him anymore.",
  "he was a busy OCCUPATION.",
  "have you ever thought of just cutting down?",
  "yes he sounds like a great OCCUPATION.",
  "they do dance and smile more.",
  "i was going to mention that as well.",
  "he was multi-talented for sure.",
  "funny that they have their own PRODUCT called 'bookerly'.",
  "i agree altering PRODUCT as well.",
  "yeah that must have cost them more than the EVENT itself",
  "i think it would.",
  "that is good then.",
  "no, no.",
  "lol - that's crazy!",
  "i bet  he does.",
  "yes, it's very good.",
  "i'll have to watch how much FOOD i have.",
  "did he do something wrong?",
  "yeah check it out.",
  "it's three different FOOD mixed together.",
  "he even came back with PERSON-she was directing him.",
  "it's an old PRODUCT.",
  "how about drinking FOOD?",
  "i used to have a PRODUCT yeah",
  "even some famous ORG like ringo!",
  "no doubt always been this crazy.",
  "i love them as well.",
  "i am now.",
  "i try to avoid the BUSINESS.",
  "i've already got mine.",
  "yes, i ache all over.",
  "yeah it is pretty good.",

  "i had read that before.",
  "i'm not sure...i'll you",
  "yeah. ORG plays live pretty often it seems.",
  "that is so fascinating.",
  "you'd better spell that!",
  "i know some junior high ORG who can stay out later than that.",
  "i think i ‘ d say LOCATION.",
  "i'm just curious.",
  "these PRODUCT aren ’ t very difficult to use.",
  "the robber came in with a PRODUCT.",
  "i never learned PRODUCT.",
  "just smaller.",
  "i would appreciate that.",
  "i can agree to that.",
  "oh, no, get off it.",
  "em, as i have said, i'm diligent and industrious.",
  "that is what i was told.",
  "not together.",
  "lo.",
  "yeah i guess you never know.",
  "they indeed are more smart.",
  "oh you're right",
  "$ 3 075.",
  "it sounds racist.",
  "i'm not practicing enough.",
  "i didnt",
  "you'd be pretty fit!",
  "i would assume so.",
  "somehow i don't believe that.",
  "i thought there were more!",
  "that i can agree with.",
  "super!",
  "well yes i am actually.",
  "do you enjoy TYPE_OF_SPORT?",
  "yeah they seem to have spread out there too.",
  "yeah i think that is so interesting!",

  "yeah. sounds demanding.",
  "do you plan on voting?",
  "i really can't wait that long.",
  "next wednesday.",
  "ya i think it is.",
  "i have almost stepped on a few when they wash up on the LOCATION.",
  "i'm not too familiar.",
  "i heard his collegiate TYPE_OF_SPORT was lackluster at best.",
  "it's pretty sunny here.",
  "quite fascinating.",
  "i think i'll look it up on PRODUCT later.",
  "is it effective?",
  "i was robbed.",
  "that would be really cool to hear!",
  "it's going to be set in LOCATION.",
  "yes, they are just next to the BUSINESS actually.",
  "that does sound pretty funny.",
  "yeah i don't use it for that.",
  "yeah it definitely is the world's most popular TYPE_OF_SPORT!",
  "i cannot believe they paid between 100 and 120.",
  "wow i should check that out.",
  "i used to love that one.",
  "exactly and although it sounds confusing it does kind of explain it.",
  "wait, what are you doing!",
  "yeah this cannot happen.",
  "oh, let me see...",
  "i used to listen to the PRODUCT when i was younger.",
  "i know it's painful, but it's only temporary.",
  "no, LOCATION isn't very mountainous.",
  "they plan to install a PRODUCT here.",
  "that would be cool somehow.",
  "when BUSINESS went down to 40%",
  "yes, it's a PRODUCT.",
  "i think she used to be at least.",
  "it is on the PRODUCT over there.",
  "well, talk to him, and let me know what happens, ok?",
  "i think they mean currently....",
  "wow i did not know that!",
  "i like to read too.",
  "to me he did something that i love.",
  "maybe they could.",
  "i only watch TYPE_OF_SPORT.",
  "it is not something that i ever got into.",
  "no, i think the MUSIC_GENRE is too fast.",
  "that would be fun to hear.",
  "i used to love them !",
  "it was great chatting w/you!",
  "it will cost you $ 10.",
  "how are you going to get there?",
  "i think i ’ d go lonely if i do like that.",

  "let ’ s go to LOCATION.",
  "ya i don't know they must.",
  "in the early 1920s.",
  "yeah that's true about that.",
  "i'm not even sure i was aware of it back then.",
  "it is not in the us.",
  "do you know what's wrong with my pc?",
  "i am sure he was ok.",
  "i never saw it either.",
  "why ’ d you have to do that?",
  "that right.",
  "carjacking must be common.",
  "i dont know how that would even happen!",
  "i don ’ t believe that.",
  "you should do that.",
  "why can't stuff like that happen to me?",
  "that makes me so angry.",
  "no, you aren't.",
  "it is true and sad.",
  "i dont use it as much as i used to.",
  "yeah it is sexist and it really needs to go",

  "that is so cool how invlolved he is.",
  "i love the PRODUCT.",
  "i don't really watch much tv.",
  "im not sure what PRODUCT they used.",
  "yeah they have a good WORK_OF_ART.",
  "ok but you must stay calm.",
  "i wonder what he saw in them.",
  "what else do you suggest?",
  "that would be fun.",
  "not sure on that one!",
  "because... i don't know.",
  "no, i never did.",
  "i guess...",
  "i go sometimes.",
  "they have removed them.",
  "if you need anything else, just let me know.",
  "it should stop you from overdrafting.",
  "thank you for helping me.",
  "i wonder how they measure that.",
  "mr. : just like everyone else.",
  "i bet it's expensive.",
  "what is dream day?",
  "it must be well liked since the BUSINESS is valued at $104 billion.",
  "thats interesting.",
  "i think they have way more.",
  "16 divided by 2 equals 8.",
  "well, you ’ re in the right BUSINESS.",
  "just tell her off.",
  "if you are in LOCATION.",
  "i came here from BUSINESS.",
  "sometimes they do, sometimes they don't.",
  "i think it's great to learn about.",
  "i can only imagine how exhausting that must be as well.",
  "oh that explains it then.",
  "the EVENT really didn ’ t go down well at all.",
  "yuck.",
  "that's interesting.",
  "yes, follow me.",
  "what else will ORG need?",
  "i heard about the 1 BUSINESS.",
  "not that i know if.",
  "that does sound exhausting.",
  "i own one.",
  "i guess you can write that i'm looking forward to seeing them in june.",
  "he is from LOCATION.",
  "yeah i love learning and reading about it.",
  "at 8",
  "i didn't know that before.",
  "i've heard of it.",

  "hmmm i think they have PRODUCT on them though.",
  "yeah they did try and do it themselves.",
  "back then it was worth 500 million.",
  "we're using PRODUCT.",
  "i can't tell yet.",
  "ok, whatever, i don't want to hear about it.",
  "i think i heard something about there being only one.",
  "LOCATION is too.",
  "i wish you luck.",
  "i don ’ t know, i just saw the PRODUCT and thought about how pretty it looks and how much i wanted it.",
  "that's even better than i heard...",
  "they have made it.",
  "very lush.",
  "i cant say that i have.",
  "that seems likely.",
  "yes, that's very important.",
  "i think that's awesome.",
  "i would know if i bought something that expensive.",
  "think he is better at WORK_OF_ART anyways.",
  "i ’ ve been thinking of doing that lately!",
  "im not sure how he did it but it sure is intriguing.",
  "oh yeah !",
  "i like receiving PRODUCT.",
  "yes, it is so.",
  "i would have loved to have been to that EVENT.",
  "it is really condensed.",
  "fair enough!",
  "i actually am.",
  "i'm so pleased that you can go.",
  "that must suck.",
  "i always wondered if they passed LOCATION by.",
  "i dont remember that one.",
  "i don't think i saw it.",
  "that is pretty cool and monumental.",
  "the simpsons?",
  "what should i do about it?",
  "oh wow yea he's getting up there.",
  "no!  i was asking where they hide the PRODUCT when they are stealing it.",
  "i am sure it did and they capitalized on it too obviously",
  "yeah and it would cost you $300 to travel the LOCATION",
  "they do.",
  "hee.",
  "yes, it will be ready then.",
  "no. who are they?",
  "but they're still wealthy enough to have thought of buying it.",
  "yes, it's right over here.",
  "um, well let's see... i'm from LOCATION originally.",
  "i don't know for sure.",
  "i don't play any PRODUCT.",
  "that is not cheap!",
  "i believe it was a ORG who were married.",
  "sometimes i wish they still used PRODUCT like that!",
  "i guess he really like PRODUCT.",
  "but how will you know how much i should pay?",
  "really, she's so pretty.",
  "i hope it makes it to those that need it.",
  "thats kind of ironic.",
  "are you having a big EVENT?",
  "i was surprised by that.",
  "meh.",
  "because apparently you will enjoy it more",
  "he is!!",
  "that would be cool",
  "yes, this is.",

  "does it always close at six?",
  "well, we have some handmade PRODUCT.",
  "not so surprisingly.",
  "they said that it was terrible when young.",
  "do you travel abroad much?",
  "alex smith?",

  "it ’ s nearly half past seven.",
  "i know its so upsetting!",
  "it was really nice talking to you too.",
  "yeah and it only had 54 PRODUCT",
  "ok great, i ’ ll see you at six.",
  "from LOCATION.",
  "it is amazing that something could live forever when everything else seems destined to die.",
  "i want to go shopping in LOCATION.",
  "very!",
  "how does that even work?",
  "i bet they were!",
  "this is true.",
  "i have been curious about it too.",
  "how about mac donald's?",
  "do you know why PRODUCT is mainly blue?",
  "right - but not sure how successful PRODUCT was.",
  "i think it pays to be well-rounded.",
  "i'm not positive if it does or not.",
  "yes and he never used a PRODUCT.",
  "i did too",
  "it very well could be.",
  "oh nice i love a good WORK_OF_ART.",

  "how could you not notice it?",
  "no that doesn't sound like it.",
  "do you mind if i sit down?",
  "ok, i'll talk to you soon.",

  "i do like that it runs an PRODUCT.",
  "you're right",

  "why didn't she call me?",
  "do you think they ’ ll get back together?",
  "i will take the PRODUCT then.",
  "right thats what i thought!",

  "do you think i should wear a different PRODUCT?",
  "no, you haven ’ t.",
  "lol  yes!",
  "it is very devastating.",
  "they sure can.",
  "what about here in physical ACADEMIC_DISCIPLINE?",
  "she did.",
  "that what i was about to ask you...",

  "do you like ACADEMIC_DISCIPLINE?",
  "i hope they did not.",
  "oh wow yes it is really nice.",
  "can she speak LANGUAGE?",
  "not sure",
  "it is true you do have to focus on the PRODUCT.",
  "if you do.",
  "i think i could too!",
  "yes it is very creepy sometimes!",
  "there is so much.",
  "it might be better to be an OCCUPATION though.",
  "nope i don't think it does.",
  "yes i have heard of him.",
  "well, they sent me their WORK_OF_ART, so i can start looking now.",
  "maybe the FOOD had something wrong with it.",

  "i am not sure...",
  "i guess you could choose that if you wanted.",
  "i love dogs!",
  "oh that is good then.",
  "i heard that about WORK_OF_ART.",
  "that's funny when you think of it now.",
  "i think he may try but it's up in the LOCATION whether he will pull it off",
  "im not totally sure.",
  "so what happened next?",
  "i didn't hear that one.",
  "they don't show that on tv!",
  "i bet it is too!",
  "in march 2014.",

  "they are very unusual.",
  "that's really terrible.",
  "yeah that is an interesting one.",
  "indeed, it's unfair.",
  "is it possible to arrest them all for doing nothing?",
  "it's far away.",
  "tell him i hope he's better soon.",
  "ah thats true.",
  "i don't read it as much as i should.",
  "it was one of the first PRODUCT i owned.",

  "455623.",
  "LOCATION would be fun.",
  "i like to play.",
  "he did but i get it.",
  "i think that they still need to cancel FAC.",
  "i think i should too.",
  "not sure what it would be.",
  "i hope so  too how about TYPE_OF_SPORT.",
  "do they have it in large.",
  "they would have to be pretty desparate to put one out on the LOCATION.",
  "yeah i can support that myself.",
  "lets talk about rapping next.",
  "imagine if they still did that now.",
  "now that sounds funny.",
  "then one to LOCATION at ten thirty.",
  "that's cool i wonder what is inside.",
  "yes, it's beautiful, but it's also very hot.",
  "yes, i think they might have gone to the same ORG or something like that.",
  "i went this EVENT and didn't see any.",
  "now that interests me.",
  "don't you have FOOD?",
  "i wonder if declaring someone an honorary OCCUPATION is one.",
  "i bet that was interesting.",
  "you can take that with you.",
  "i mean regardless.",
  "ok, you ’ ll need to reboot your PRODUCT.",
  "how about here in LOCATION?",
  "i bet the PRODUCT went crazy!",
  "i think i heard that.",
  "i was kidding.",
  "no. are they good?",
  "ok... i'm just going to lay it all out on the table, what do you think of PERSON's management style?",
  "hey !",
  "that is wild!",
  "we are glad to hear that.",
  "i know, fresh FOOD flavored is the best ever.",
  "you are not going to give it up, are you?",
  "i like the ORG just because that is where i'm from.",
  "i'm very surprised that happened.",
  "really honestly i don't use it for that.",
  "he tried to come back.",
  "he could have gotten both.",
  "that's pretty impressive.",
  "ha that would be wild to see!",
  "yes...there's a wide variety of viewpoints.",
  "wonderful WORK_OF_ART.",
  "i ’ d like to speak with mr. PERSON.",
  "that's easier to understand.",
  "that is cool and i wonder who removed them from there to begin with.",
  "i think that's funny!",
  "hang on, let me finish telling you what happened.",
  "i feel i really stupid.",
  "is it really going to take that long?",
  "good!",
  "ok.please sit down.",
  "she might do well.",
  "just about everywhere i go i have to drive.",
  "what was he doing?",
  "is this where we'll be holding the EVENT?",
  "well, i'll see.",
  "i'm aware of that.",
  "i think it's interesting to watch.",
  "yeah PERSON has got it made.",
  "i think that would be really cool.",
  "very well, consider me gone.",
  "he is a \"PRODUCT-in\" for the hall of fame!",
  "so is PERSON.",
  "did not know that either",
  "yeah i didn't know that either.",
  "i wonder why they have them!",
  "i think the PRODUCT is faulty.",
  "i ’ m afraid i never go for a EVENT.",
  "okay, forget about that.",
  "would you like some FOOD?",
  "that is terrible!",
  "i enjoy sci-fi.",
  "i don't use the PRODUCT",
  "that's cool he added those to it.",
  "maybe he does.",
  "yeah must have been some PRODUCT there.",
  "what did it say about you then?",
  "really does it work perfectly?",
  "probably equal actually.",
  "i also didnt think that was right.",
  "i want to.",
  "oh, that's too bad.",
  "now it's longer and getting even longer.",
  "ah, you changed so fast.",
  "let's see how much the LAW is.",
  "well like hank williams sr.",
  "i am aware of who PERSON is.",
  "i think they did not expect it to be so complex.",
  "there must be.",
  "that is pretty sad!",
  "i was about to search it.",
  "what examinations?",
  "i'll plan for the EVENT.",
  "i won't be paying you for this.",
  "i think BUSINESS made it right?",
  "i don' t think it's racist.",
  "i was a TYPE_OF_SPORT.",
  "it is i have been wanting to watch it again.",
  "that's new to me.",
  "it was nice chatting with you also!",
  "that is probably where most of the PRODUCT i buy are made.",
  "oh, yes.",
  "yeah i heard that they would do that that's pretty funny!",
  "it is kind of crazy.",
  "probably not and he has never eaten a FOOD!",
  "and she's good at TYPE_OF_SPORT, too.",
  "wouldn't you rather hear a qb just say \"yeah.",
  "what about that one over there?",
  "it's one of his super WORK_OF_ART.",
  "who is laughing now though.",
  "ya i do.",
  "i am one that always seems to be checking for PRODUCT!!",
  "then i bet he's really good!",
  "so do we.",
  "i love fishing for sure.",
  "yes, surely.",
  "is the PRODUCT sturdy?",
  "surprised its higher than 1%!",
  "i would be curious to know if PERSON is the wealthiest.",
  "i would not be surprised if they are selectively bred to code!",
  "when is it due?",
  "i would hope they would enjoy it.",
  "exactly how much do i owe?",
  "it ’ s easy to say, but i will try.",
  "i think we can visit LOCATION.",
  "well it was nice talking to you",
  "could i see both of them?",
  "WORK_OF_ART it all!",
  "she was.",
  "yeah he is pretty good.",
  "he is a OCCUPATION.",
  "and.",
  "yeah, i'm expecting to come back on tuesday.",
  "CHAMPIONSHIP was one of the best so far",
  "it is something kinda innovative and ever changing.",
  "that sounds reasonable.",
  "i wonder why they did that.",
  "are they genuine?",
  "i can't either.",
  "yeah very surprising.",
  "around 3:30.",
  "actually, i'd prefer not to be.",
  "im not to familiar with the LAW.",
  "now you've stumped me with that.",
  "now that would make the PRODUCT more interesting.",
  "i don't know of anyone that does that either.",
  "christopher columbus?",
  "i'm sure he would and probably has!",
  "i'm sure that is what it is really for.",
  "ok.but which PRODUCT should i use?",
  "i'm sure you'll look grand when it's done.",
  "well it has been nice chatting with you.",
  "i agree with him.",
  "i still like BUSINESS.",
  "i don't really use them but they're important.",
  "no, i wouldn't worry about you.",
  "thirteen.",
  "is it anything like TYPE_OF_SPORT?",
  "agree again.",
  "i read that too.",
  "that is smart of them.",
  "no, that's ok.i've got all of your information here on the screen in front of me.",
  "hmmm....never heard of him.",
  "can you make my PRODUCT short?",
  "yeah. sounds pretty comical.",
  "you're joking!",
  "c :: four by six will do.",
  "not a BUSINESS.",
  "doesn't surprise me to be honest.",
  "i certainly can.",
  "i couldn't that's for sure.",
  "let's hope so.",
  "mystery!",
  "no i didnt actually.",
  "ok, but don't say i didn't warn you.",
  "i'm not sure if he is or not, but i thought he was definitely fair.",
  "i've heard of him.",
  "i am too.",
  "i didn't hear that.",
  "sometimes, but i guess not very often.",
  "i like almost all TYPE_OF_SPORT, and i enjoy both playing and watching.",
  "i really like the SPORT_TEAM.",
  "still here",
  "ok, i want you to be happy when we are together, and when you are sad, i would always stay with you.",
  "i wonder how that happened.",
  "i heard that he did that while he was in OCCUPATION.",
  "that would be insane.",
  "yes because it was easier to dial on a rotary PRODUCT",
  "because i ’ m very competent in this LOCATION.",
  "i just don't like my PRODUCT.",
  "let me stretch it for you.",
  "do you listen to PRODUCT at all?",
  "that is just too funny.",
  "maybe... i'll think about it.",
  "i don't know enough about WORK_OF_ART to even begin to imagine.",
  "that can be easily done.",
  "i am not sure i have heard his MUSIC_GENRE.",
  "but that takes too long.",
  "do you have any now?",
  "i think everyone will be at the EVENT in 2020.",
  "i'll bet that's cool.",
  "i'm familiar with it.",
  "i don't know where to go to get one.",
  "PERSON is beautiful.",
  "that's also scary.",
  "yeah they did.",
  "thank you for shopping here.",
  "likewise.. i meant now.",
  "i would think so also.",
  "i love TYPE_OF_SPORT as well.",
  "nice talking with you as well.",
  "lets talk about ORG next.",
  "PRODUCT...",
  "did you count them personally?",
  "yeah i don't think that would go over so well either.",
  "that is pretty awesome.",
  "did they take his LAW away?",
  "yeah, and it's bigger than ours was.",
  "please fill out this PRODUCT.",
  "he was a mechanical ACADEMIC_DISCIPLINE.",
  "PRODUCT have changed so much.",
  "yeah.that is how i feel.",
  "neither do i.i don't like any kind of modern dances all.",
  "unique, aren ’ t they?",
  "i thought you would be worried about it.",
  "ok, i'll just check out a few other BUSINESS.",
  "sorry, but he's busy then too.",
  "yeah that would be concerning.",
  "i wonder who figured that out.",
  "yeah, i'm very nauseous.",
  "you've been through this too?",
  "my gosh!",
  "oh haha sorry i forgot.",
  "well up until 1998.",
  "yeah i would think so.",
  "i would feel bad if i were those two!",
  "they started out so good.",
  "i like you.",
  "that was extremely nice of her.",
  "i plead not guilty.",
  "sounds really hard.",
  "how long do you want to sign a LAW for?",
  "i can.",
  "boring?",
  "phrasing!",
  "it would be LOCATION",
  "how long will you study there.",
  "yeah that is very true as well.",
  "i havent read his PRODUCT.",
  "i can think of five FAC that we should look at.",
  "it can also help you burn FOOD",
  "im not quite sure.",
  "i am glad you enjoy it.",
  "what a NORP!",
  "you are indeed wise.",
  "it does make the PRODUCT easier to watch.",
  "PRODUCT is small and nimble.",
  "i wasn't happy with it.",
  "ya it is kind of scary with how much they own.",
  "oh wow that's it?",
  "each of both.",
  "i'm ready to go right now.",
  "i think it's the BUSINESS.",
  "around 9 p. m.",
  "i can, but i'm not going to.",
  "is there anything else i can help you with?",
  "he could.",
  "do you know what to get?",
  "not actively.",
  "so tremendously sad to hear that.",
  "i wonder what they do with the old PRODUCT.",
  "yes it seems like it.",
  "i visited once.",
  "well i have been thinking about getting a newer PRODUCT.",
  "if you consider 6' 1\" short.",
  "no, i knew it all along.",
  "first, i worked as a OCCUPATION.",
  "when i was on there i almost only looked at people's PRODUCT.",
  "liars.",
  "it was really good talking to you!",
  "i think they just can't take the PRODUCT offline to upgrade.",
  "i looked it up.",
  "are you on the up and up?",
  "there are a few of them out now.",
  "NORP?",
  "and now?",
  "that also sounds great.",
  "she is pretty serious about it.",
  "that looks lovely.",
  "that's ok.we can go jogging, after we eat!",
  "i'd get it myself if i could.",
  "i remember that too.",
  "oh so its called a PRODUCT.",
  "i'm not too familiar with OCCUPATION so i want to ask.",
  "i know i wonder who put it up there?",
  "no i didn't watch it.",
  "can i board the PRODUCT now?",
  "i would think it would be pretty hard to relate to a OCCUPATION from so long ago.",
  "i have an PRODUCT...",
  "that sounds really cool.",
  "uh, i can see that.",
  "that could be beneficial.",
  "that is very inventive and rather WORK_OF_ART actually.",
  "yeah it seems like its always been like that.",
  "yeah i should look that up on PRODUCT.",
  "i don't understand how.",
  "he has been known to be one.",
  "i ’ m fine.",
  "that's a pretty special PRODUCT!",
  "i know never!!",
  "how'd you measure or prove it.",
  "that's hard to imagine!",
  "it starts at $ 30,000.",
  "well, can you be more specific?",
  "that's really cool.",
  "he has won many OCCUPATION .",
  "isn't that crazy?!",
  "who would have thought that?",
  "let me see them.",
  "i faintly remember it but don't remember it being so great",
  "does he call himself OCCUPATION?",
  "that bad, huh?",
  "1564.",
  "she is so funny.",
  "i guess he is!",
  "and it says that it sleeps.",
  "PERSON isn't particularly rich compared to them.",
  "my PRODUCT is stuck.",
  "well that is very interesting.",
  "probably so",
  "agreed it would have!",
  "let me try it on.",
  "i dont really know about that.",
  "well it worked for a while anyways up until 1805.",
  "yeah, uh, it's outside.",
  "that might be legal in LOCATION but i doubt it would fly in the us.",
  "what do you say next wednesday then?",
  "i'm honored that you think i would be qualified.",
  "they definitely do.",
  "i like ACADEMIC_DISCIPLINE.",
  "that's pretty funny.",
  "don't even think that far ahead.",
  "yes, that ’ s funny.",
  "yeah that was also really good.",
  "hopefully it was published.",
  "some of them are pretty good.",
  "i am not very sure of that.",
  "seems like it.",
  "oh really...",
  "that's a strange WORK_OF_ART!",
  "i'm not sure at all.",
  "i think it would be cool to become an immortal PRODUCT.",
  "i would have loved to see them beat LOCATION for sure.",
  "i've heard of it",
  "i watch some but not that much.",
  "aha !",
  "oh that's great.",
  "how'd they do that.",
  "that's too bad, but don't worry.",
  "yeah they really have.",
  "oh i think you're right!",
  "my PRODUCT looks awful.",
  "no, it's not necessary since the PRODUCT is not big.",
  "if only i was talented.",
  "ok.i see.",
  "let's walk around the LOCATION first, shall we?",
  "$ 16.",
  "he's smart.",
  "and they're happy with that?",
  "yeah that might make him angry.",
  "i requested it.",
  "that is true and that is by LAW..",
  "i have not read him",
  "right now BUSINESS has it.",
  "i wonder how on LOCATION they did that?",
  "this is wonderful.",
  "do you know where she went?",
  "how do you feel about that?",
  "we'll go to your FAC and repair it on tuesday.",
  "then, what would make you feel more comfortable?",
  "this is neat!",
  "i'll be careful.",
  "you should be able to.",
  "oh, it's too spicy for me.",
  "!!",
  "i can't believe he did that.",
  "they must be.",
  "but when he was introduced.",
  "he's there.",
  "yes, we certainly are.",
  "oh, that's very considerate of you.",
  "i have not heard about the FAC.",
  "let me weight it first.",
  "oh that is very generous of him wow.",
  "i wonder how that still flies there",
  "that will be ok.",
  "that doesn't even sound real.",
  "i would think it was because PRODUCT was more available.",
  "that would have been amazing to see.",
  "i haven't heard anything about it.",
  "what are you saying?",
  "3 to 5",
  "oh, i'm afraid it's too expensive.",
  "i am guilty for contributing to that.",
  "we have that available.",
  "i ’ d like to, but i can ’ t.",
  "i think she does.",
  "yes i agree with you there.",
  "given that an authentic PRODUCT can go for as much a $200.",
  "it's easy to write those.",
  "not likely.",
  "do you know how to play it?",
  "i would definitely watch/read something that plays out like that",
  "no it was definitely with his NORP.",
  "how long have you been married?",
  "i am assuming as he signed a new LAW.",
  "i never did.",
  "i guess they do at that!",
  "yes, that's for sure.",
  "i like reading.",
  "but we need them taken with digital PRODUCT.",
  "that would be delicious.",
  "probably not the best OCCUPATION.",
  "no that's definitely strange.",
  "sorry, it ’ s impossible.",
  "still not PERSON.",
  "those are really cute.",
  "i  hope that as well.",
  "yes, i think i am quite fluent in LANGUAGE.",
  "that would look funny!",
  "that is really interesting!",
  "it is very fun.",
  "how unusual.",
  "ya i wouldnt take a $100 million PRODUCT lightly.",
  "would love to know how WORK_OF_ART effective that would be.",
  "yeah i could see that being possible.",
  "great series!",
  "agree!",
  "where are you from?",
  "that was pretty rude.",
  "that can't be true.",
  "no i haven't seen it.",
  "yes, quite right.",
  "oh, it is nice and cold, definitely good FOOD juice.",
  "yes, it is the right one",
  "that one struck me hard.",
  "PERSON really made it huge at 104 billion",
  "that's ok.thanks for your help.",
  "i'm sorry, miss.",
  "sorry, i didn't hear you.",
  "i got it from BUSINESS.",
  "no. who is he?",
  "i have not seen yet.",
  "why would anyone vote for PERSON?",
  "that makes me happy.",
  "i thought that he might be able to read some.",
  "oh my.",
  "not to mention the puzzled looks from the OCCUPATION.",
  "again.",
  "i do not have any PRODUCT.",
  "have you heard when it's supposed to get better?",
  "i wonder why they burned them.",
  "you'd look before you leap.",
  "i don't remember much either.",
  "i wish they were too.",
  "i think i will look it up on the PRODUCT and see how it is played.",
  "two national TYPE_OF_SPORT.",
  "no, i ’ d rather go out.",
  "a BUSINESS, probably.",
  "there's another distinctive WORK_OF_ART.",
  "1446 PRODUCT.",
  "they have held many EVENT.",
  "that may be true.",
  "yeah i bet you're right.",
  "i used to watch that.",
  "yes it really is impressive.",
  "if sounds so tempting.",
  "i don ’ t have a PRODUCT.",
  "yes and it took down 40% of PRODUCT with it too",
  "is 11:30 am ok?",
  "it's so powerful too.",
  "you want to send it PRODUCT, madam?",
  "it doesn't sound very exciting.",
  "that sounds like something i would like to do.",
  "it was tough.",
  "is there a LOCATION?",
  "there's nothing that can be done.",
  "actually, i ’ m FOOD",
  "have to check it out.",
  "yeah that's what i thought.",
  "i was wondering that as well when i heard about that.",
  "i don't blame them.",
  "what am i supposed to do now?",
  "byre",
  "i was wondering the same!",
  "oh wow i didn't realize that.",
  "i haven't got it in the PRODUCT yet.",
  "i didnt watch it either.",
  "haha!",
  "i will show you.",
  "i find that funny they would do that.",
  "but as an PRODUCT.",
  "i think some NATION are born deaf but not all of them are.",
  "yeah that's hard.",
  "hopefully as they travel there is a separate LOCATION for each.",
  "we both like PERSON!",
  "it is a beautiful FAC but i never would have thought to replicate it.",
  "i am not sure, where exactly is it?",
  "apparently for WORK_OF_ART.",
  "i am sure you are right.",
  "i don't know how old he is though.",
  "i think that would be interesting to watch.",
  "let me buy you a soft FOOD then.",
  "i had heard that like.",
  "well, it's getting late.",
  "it ’ s right under you!",
  "neither would i.",
  "not sure but as a formalized TYPE_OF_SPORT.",
  "yeah they say it's suppose to run for 10.000 years.",
  "i just started working out.",
  "that's cute they're so observant over something like that.",
  "i do like MUSIC_GENRE.",
  "i like most ANIMAL.",
  "please!",
  "actually it is because WORK_OF_ART is colorblind and cannot see green and red",
  "she was actually the first female ORG from ny.",
  "i already do that!",
  "yeah if i remember right it was back in the mid 90's.",
  "if we want more meaningful EVENT.",
  "just joking, t.i've got some wonderful PRODUCT.",
  "i bet they regret that!",
  "did it affect you much?",
  "oh that.",
  "that seems a little impolite in such a BUSINESS.",
  "i am thinking about going back to PRODUCT if that is possible.",
  "we don ’ t want that.",
  "i wonder why mine doesnt lol.",
  "i loved PRODUCT.",
  "i don't use an PRODUCT.",
  "i wonder which looks more lustrous.",
  "no, i wouldn't think so.",
  "well in LOCATION they used it while hunting.",
  "hmm...i did not know that.",
  "they're PRODUCT.",
  "i wish i had too",
  "yeah that would be awesome.",
  "well i hope PERSON makes one.",
  "well, i think i was being a little selfish myself.",
  "all right, see you.",
  "i've heard about PERSON.",
  "we would prefer 7",
  "LOCATION was terrible.",
  "from LOCATION thats interesting.",
  "yeah he just does not seem like the OCCUPATION that would be into that.",
  "i totally forgot.",
  "so cool of them.",
  "yes, i'll be happy to cash these for you.",
  "if i'm correct.",
  "nope i don't remember that but that is huge!",
  "which is more expensive?",
  "do you mean how that one BUSINESS feels?",
  "i heard that!",
  "ok, well, what did you want to see me about?",
  "oh for sure i understand that.",
  "thank you for telling me about this.",
  "he does only WORK_OF_ART now.",
  "we have a ANIMAL.",
  "no i don't think so either.",
  "he must must be good.",
  "oh yeah looks like it happened back in 2001.",
  "let's go.",
  "those are pretty good OCCUPATION as well.",
  "yeah it is silly looking.",
  "they are all great TYPE_OF_SPORT and very experienced.",
  "that's actually very interesting.",
  "do we?",
  "ok, i will inform everybody when they come back from EVENT.",
  "ya i like it.",
  "that might be why we love them so much.",
  "that is pretty awesome that they invited it.",
  "i love to cook.",
  "i had heard that.",
  "ok.that's fine.",
  "that is quite interesting.",
  "how fine the PRODUCT is!",
  "ya i do like him.",
  "sure, but you really did great and outperformed the ORG.",
  "you know, now that i think about it, you might be right.",
  "that's good your ORG cared.",
  "i need to check out this PRODUCT.",
  "let me see here.",
  "be confident.",
  "i have never seen hummingbird in my LOCATION.",
  "you think he might stay even longer?!",
  "i wasn't able to.",
  "is there LAW?",
  "gee, i don't think i own any red PRODUCT, but i can buy some!",
  "that'll be fine.",
  "we can do it.",
  "she was?",
  "that's interesting i didn't know that.",
  "the train?",
  "i hope BUSINESS does not agree to sell.",
  "yeah that would be nice to see what they sound like.",
  "yes. isn't that awesome?",
  "well, i'll see you at 6 p. m. do you know how to get there?",
  "how long does the LOCATION no. 5 last?",
  "i had heard of that.",
  "he was falsely imprisoned.",
  "it wouldn't seem right if it started raining right now.",
  "yeah that is odd.",
  "he is that really smart OCCUPATION right?",
  "do you know what they are playing?",
  "okay you've got me there.",
  "if they get even longer.",
  "yeah and now she is such a strong POLITICAL_PARTY",
  "since it's not working, i'm going to give you a LAW.",
  "yes but it has been downhill for us since then unfortunately",
  "wow, that's really old.",
  "now BUSINESS is worth $2 billion.",
  "i wonder why he was so influential enough.",
  "i was sick.",
  "that is pretty crazy how the EVENT works in the us.",
  "i do not get to go as often as i used to.",
  "thats probably true.",
  "no i guess not.",
  "i think you're correct.",
  "although it's not the most popular in the us.",
  "i am sure it is.",
  "yes, when it snows, every where is white.",
  "i read them sometimes.",
  "she is very nice and open-minded.",
  "he actively manages them?",
  "that is true ha.",
  "he's started 16 SPORTS_SEASON",
  "i do recall.",
  "it's been great chatting with you.",
  "would you please reconsider?",
  "i completely forgot!",
  "it's in the LOCATION.",
  "well, the WORK_OF_ART is for me!",
  "thats great.....",
  "no they do not.",
  "that is exciting!",
  "i am not too sure how i feel.",
  "thats hard to believe.",
  "will you exfoliate the PRODUCT as well?",
  "that is good to hear.",
  "104 billion last checked",
  "i think i might have set up an BUSINESS and never gone back to use it ever again.",
  "who doesn't!",
  "LOCATION?",
  "yeah i think its the ORG.",
  "thank you, you too.",
  "i'll have to look more up about him.",
  "yes they own about 86% of it",
  "apparently if you visit LOCATION.",
  "i would be joining you in LOCATION.",
  "it does fit PRODUCT.",
  "do you want to go to an EVENT?",
  "yeah and he was not even mentioned in it at all",
  "no, i can't be there.",
  "team iphone!",
  "why are you washing your PRODUCT here now?",
  "i liked it.",
  "thirty two PRODUCT.",
  "there is some NORP happening in the us!",
  "do you think we are related to WORK_OF_ART?",
  "i got them for forty.",
  "no – that ’ s all right.",
  "and that was cool of him.",
  "interesting .",
  "no, it's ok.",
  "yeah, like it very much.",
  "i ’ ll call you if i ’ m delayed.",
  "she is?",
  "yes, that's quite all right for me.",
  "that is really neat.",
  "ok.you can change it.",
  "what about the FOOD?",
  "don't have anything against him.",
  "oh, that would be too small.",
  "actually, i don't think you can call the ORG.",
  "i am watching that right now.",
  "agreed there is.",
  "i know what overbooked is, i just don ’ t understand how that could happen?",
  "i will be sending the assistant OCCUPATION to check it out.",
  "who's the director?",
  "ok... what about PRODUCT?..",
  "thank you so much!",
  "it is truly sad.",
  "i think they might.",
  "a little, but not much.",
  "that is not true.",
  "it's very pleasant.",
  "ya i'll check it out.",
  "do you play on a SPORT_TEAM?",
  "but it isnt the biggest.",
  "i have never seen those before, but since you're so excited it should be good.",
  "ORG's dark side of the moon!",
  "here's 20.",
  "oh yes we did lol.",
  "it's in the c FAC.",
  "i am sorry to hear that.",
  "i guess they could but who would do it?",
  "i have owned 3 PRODUCT.",
  "i think it was the PRODUCT.",
  "you can see LOCATION.",
  "it's really healthy to do some TYPE_OF_SPORT there.",
  "rick berry knows!",
  "i agree .it",
  "what do you want me to do with that PRODUCT over there?",
  "i would love to hear one of those.",
  "if i were accepted into ORG i would think twice.",
  "not sure where you are geographically.",
  "so, you have your own PRODUCT?",
  "that would be sad if it did go down with the ORG.",
  "that's really generous.",
  "alright this is a good one.",
  "probably a general WORK_OF_ART.",
  "what would you like to go with your FOOD?",
  "i do not",
  "he can be choosy as he wants.",
  "ah that is cool.",
  "it might no be necessary.",
  "i do play sometimes.",
  "his WORK_OF_ART is imaginative and seems so unrealistic.",
  "i would too.",
  "guess i don't know about that.",
  "we should probably think about going somewhere that isn't too far away.",
  "64 PRODUCT, please.",
  "has anybody spoken to him about it?",
  "not sure to be honest.",
  "unbelievable!",
  "that is so interesting to learn.",
  "from the mlb?",
  "did you think about talking to her again?",
  "i wonder what they sound like?",
  "he played in LOCATION and shandong!!",
  "he performs very well.",
  "yeah but i dont go to too many of them.",
  "it's too bad.",
  "i have watched some",
  "i wonder what goes on there.",
  "oh that's true.",
  "BUSINESS was smart to buy them out!",
  "okay, i'll grill some FOOD then.",
  "you are close.",
  "isn't that heartbreaking?",
  "it smells sweet.",
  "yeah, i'm afraid so.",
  "yep i've heard that they do that too.",
  "born in LOCATION.",
  "you really have to?",
  "oh, it's really beautiful, but i just can't dance it well.",
  "why don't we take him out?",
  "he deserved it.",
  "yeah i can see why it is popular enough.",
  "not on PRODUCT though.",
  "yeah i don't know why.",
  "all right, can i have your PRODUCT?",
  "not sure about that one.",
  "i wonder what that entails.",
  "ture.",
  "i'll be sure to do that.",
  "sorry, not before 10:30.",
  "yeah i was quite surprised with that as well.",
  "don't try to encourage me.",
  "that is what i thought too!",
  "i was not aware that they also own BUSINESS.",
  "that would be so cool.",
  "i turned on my PRODUCT and it broke!",
  "i don't know what we need.",
  "don't you think it ’ s too noisy here?",
  "i know it is pretty odd.",
  "it's funny that some of it probably predates writing.",
  "to say the least.",
  "i guess there is no LAW against it.",
  "yeah i remember seeing that.",
  "new house?",
  "i'm sure it wasn't easy though.",
  "weird that a PRODUCT could be so lifelike.",
  "it comes on the PRODUCT.",
  "no. not that.",
  "yep i guess so.",
  "that would not be fun.",
  "i wouldn't agree with that.",
  "that's odd.",
  "let ’ s meet at 12:30.",
  "she's impressive.",
  "i think you should definitely apply for the OCCUPATION.",
  "i don't really to fb much.",
  "i didn't know that but i do like ORG.",
  "yes i have heard of it.",
  "that i can totally see.",
  "i do enjoy the PRODUCT.",
  "i wish i got paid that.",
  "i apologize, but i'm getting off the BUSINESS now.",
  "ya that would be very cool if they plull it off.",
  "if only!",
  "what is your most favorite PRODUCT?",
  "yeah you wouldn't think so.",
  "nope that's what i heard.",
  "yep he was awesome.",
  "yes, but do you have your learner's LAW?",
  "i have heard.",
  "hopefully not long.",
  "i dont think he was either.",
  "woah really?",
  "how would you suggest we address it now?",
  "i don't know what to make.",
  "no, they're still working on it.",
  "i don't understand why you would do that.",
  "ah yeah i did hear that.",
  "yeah i would have to watch it as well!",
  "ya hes really interesting.",
  "i think it would be good.",
  "i wonder how good they were.",
  "so no. 4 is your favorite.",
  "i understand LOCATION.",
  "the OCCUPATION.",
  "$ 4.55, please.",
  "they are really long.",
  "i try not to think about it!",
  "mostly WORK_OF_ART.",
  "they need to talk with the NATION.",
  "it probably is.",
  "oh, yes, he is brilliant.",
  "they are so perceptive.",
  "would you please ask when he will be free?",
  "didn't that just come out in october?",
  "which LOCATION would you like to work in?",
  "i bet it is PRODUCT now.",
  "anything can be addictive.",
  "sure, when those never ending EVENT.",
  "ahh...ok.",
  "it definitely has!",
  "no.  i did not know that.",
  "i wouldn't doubt it.",
  "i know they don't hire ORG to do it.",
  "no, i am not a shopaholic, but a super shopaholic.",
  "wow that's much lighter compared to a regular one.",
  "i guess it was inevitable.",
  "i find that odd.",
  "yeah i wouldn't be surprised.",
  "PERSON. is the only one i can think of.",
  "i actually knew that one.",
  "i wonder if i can use your PRODUCT.",
  "perhaps that had something to do with it.",
  "that sounds pretty good.",
  "yep that was really smart!",
  "i think i remember it better now.",

  "whatever you choose, make sure they are neat and clean.",
  "that does not surprise me at all - not very durable.",
  "yeah i am the same.",
  "that must be how he developed his famous PRODUCT!",
  "oh wow i didn't know that either.",

  "i wonder if that's ever happened?",
  "i'm sure he could probably do it now if he wanted.",
  "you could probably even find it online.",
  "and celine dion!",
  "no LAW is involved.",
  "i love driving.",
  "it has been nice!",
  "i think it's a decent LAW.",
  "you would think that rather than compromising.",
  "i agree with you on that.",
  "they probably are both very smart.",
  "20kg.",
  "it's frustrating!",
  "it is just sad that someone somewhere had to do it once.",
  "that's enough for the ORG.",

  "that seems fishy.",
  "i dont want to know.",
  "would the ORG fix it?",
  "yes, i think i did.",
  "how much does it pay?",

  "i always wondered why.",
  "yeah, i agree with you.",
  "i'm going to have to check it out.",
  "i didnt know that either.",
  "it's such a global TYPE_OF_SPORT.",

  "i'd like a little FOOD, please.",
  "yep that's probably true.",
  "i like to use BUSINESS.",
  "private collectors!",

  "i think they would be ok.",
  "WORK_OF_ART, i think.",
  "that's very interesting.",
  "fine, and what about something to drink?",
  "i never really liked it",
  "i have heard about that but haven't checked it out yet.",
  "yeah it didn't make much since to me either.",
  "wow i wouldn't have expected that from PERSON!",
  "and next?",
  "ok, i know what you mean.",
  "can you recommend some to me?",
  "i wonder if he was lying about that as well.",
  "i will never understand that but it's crazy for sure!",
  "yeah, i suppose you wouldn't want to see that, huh?",
  "i actually i did know that...",
  "i don't think that matters though.",
  "didnt know that.",
  "do you use your PRODUCT much?",

  "yeah PERSON is always planning something.",
  "i don't  know.",
  "why did he do that?",
  "no i don't i don't know anything about them.",
  "i was surprised to find that out too.",
  "i can't imagine.",
  "well, easily, it doesn't work.",
  "oh, that means i can't make sure for my own.",
  "i ’ ll tell you at the EVENT.",
  "it's fine.",
  "i can't believe she would do that to you.",
  "i beleive it.",
  "dying can be very expensive nowadays!",
  "i'm sure he wasn't too thrilled about that.",
  "oh, did you study a foreign LANGUAGE?",
  "yeah thats brutal.",
  "i looked it up and there was some WORK_OF_ART when they were both younger.",
  "it's crazy that those PRODUCT are so thin.",
  "yeah i don't know if i would like that.",
  "yes i do regularly.",
  "hmm that is interesting.",
  "i think i have heard that about him.",
  "that is massive.",
  "please look at the LOCATION.",

  "i do, but i want FOOD.",
  "no, you used to be.",
  "yes she has.",

  "i'm very excited.",
  "it's really crazy.",
  "i shall wear light PRODUCT-up instead of heavy.",
  "PRODUCT-rules?",
  "yeah mostly available in any LANGUAGE.",
  "i've always wanted to go to LOCATION.",
  "yeah i think that is so cool",
  "come to think of it, you may be on to something.",
  "i wear PRODUCT 36.",
  "that's hard to believe!",
  "so i guess i don't understand how it all works",
  "do you follow the SPORT_TEAM at all?",
  "is there any PRODUCT?",
  ":d",
  "that seems really convenient but also kind of random now that we have digital PRODUCT.",
  "well yeah",
  "i saw him perfectly.",
  "smith.",
  "i guess we could go visit once in a while too.",
  "no, he's still sleeping.",
  "well, i enjoy the FOOD and being with you.",
  "thank you for inviting me.",
  "how very appropriate!",
  "like you said.",
  "yes.indeed.",
  "yes. please.",
  "what did they say?",
  "what a OCCUPATION.",
  "look!",
  "he is NATION?",
  "i guess they were passionate about the PRODUCT.",
  "oh, my.",
  "that is very true actually.",
  "all right madam, i'll check and tell them to be quiet.",
  "no i wouldn't wear that.",
  "perhaps so.",
  "don't know anything about TYPE_OF_SPORT.",
  "i am actually not sure on that one.",
  "not as much as WORK_OF_ART",
  "that's so nuts.",
  "not that i know of!",
  "it is FOOD.",
  "i'll have to look them up.",
  "yeah that's surprising!",
  "he was only 18 then i think?",
  "it was very sad.",
  "i sure hope we are.",
  "i never got into BUSINESS.",
  "and how did you get around LOCATION?",
  "hmmm i am not sure.",
  "i know but i am assuming those might still be safer.",
  "i'd really like to read more.",
  "those always make you want to travel too",
  "it is called PRODUCT.",
  "do you often go there alone?",
  "that would be funny.",
  "ya i'm not sure",
  "have you been here before?",
  "wow. can you imagine that happening here?",
  "i didn't realize that they sleep so much or that there are over 70 NATION!",
  "oh i'm sure they are.",
  "more than i read.",
  "when do you expect him back?",
  "then tell me something about your ACADEMIC_DISCIPLINE.",
  "i've never seen WORK_OF_ART either.",
  "you will be a very promising one.",
  "yeah and they deserve it.",
  "i guess i never knew where they were located!",
  "i think many could relate; i think some are too quick to chastise someone when they can",
  "i wonder if that is going to go over really well or not.",
  "1999.",
  "LOCATION.",
  "they are based in LOCATION.",
  "that would have been great!",
  "im curious as well and kind of afraid to be honest.",
  "?",
  "i think i would pass on that one.",
  "just play it in your PRODUCT and sPRODUCTe everyone you drive by?",
  "would you like any FOOD, dear?",
  "i like both as well.",
  "i would like to see that one.",
  "i was thinking of 30 % off.",
  "i may have to check that out.",
  "she wants to be a OCCUPATION.",
  "i have used PRODUCT.",
  "friday's not good.",
  "i still own the 1985 one and it works .",
  "FOOD ’ s fine by me.",
  "i have seen that one.",
  "saturday is fine.",
  "do i didn't.",
  "visiting while i was in the ORG.",
  "just fast enough to upload a PRODUCT.",
  "that sounds cool.",
  "i think they own PRODUCT right?",
  "that's cool they let them do that!",
  "that's tough.",
  "and that everybody lies!",
  "ya that's not that long ago.",
  "i like WORK_OF_ART because it can be ambivalent.",
  "very comfortable.",
  "that's big in LOCATION",
  "transfer $ 100.",
  "maybe it actually makes them more upset and angry!",
  "i don't mind them.",
  "a ACADEMIC_DISCIPLINE?",
  "i knew the SPORT_TEAM were not very good.",
  "that makes you feel uncomfortable?",
  "that's fantastic.",
  "i never would have thought about them as being used as a PRODUCT.",
  "are you in LOCATION?",
  "yeah it is smart of him to accommodate himself.",
  "it seems like everything there is unclear and confusing.",
  "i don't think so actually.",
  "it must be well built.",
  "that was a while ago.",
  "yes but i don't think PERSON has used it yet",
  "i'm not familiar with ORG.",
  "why would they do that?",
  "english school?",
  "well, that explains it.",
  "i would like it with no FOOD, please.",
  "it is interesting.",
  "i would imagine he is.",
  "i thought they used PRODUCT always.",
  "that's gotta be expensive!",
  "PERSON is amazing.",
  "that is ridiculous.",
  "oh, yes, i would!",
  "then, let me check.",
  "i like TYPE_OF_SPORT very much.",
  "where should i go?",
  "oh yeah he sure was.",
  "i  thought it was a great EVENT",
  "oh ... me neither .",
  "at first, i thought it was me.",
  "ok. good.",
  "yeah they are funny.",
  "thank you for pursuing this.",
  "that is a little strange.",
  "yes i don't know how it's going to turn out",
  "not surprised by ny on anything.",
  "yes, i want to know about the LOCATION.",
  "ok, ok.i'll whisper it to you, but you have to promise not to tell anyone!",
  "i use to play TYPE_OF_SPORT.",
  "hard to treat because of what the LOCATION brings.",
  "well, if you decide to go, i could meet you over there at 1",
  "can i try it on and see how it looks?",
  "that is very curious.",
  "that i did not know.",
  "the PRODUCT will be ok.thanks.",
  "yes, i certainly do.",
  "do you know how to play the PRODUCT?",
  "that sounds insulting but hard to say.",
  "yes like at least PERSON can sing.",
  "well if you decide to switch it up.",
  "that seems unlikely.",
  "that ’ s great!",
  "i bet that was a great EVENT.",
  "ya i can access about anything i want.",
  "sure, we call it doubt.",
  "oh yes, you are right.",
  "then you can buy this PRODUCT.",
  "i dont think its the same.",
  "rock on!",
  "ya i need to look up what that sounds like.",
  "and i'm glad to meet you, too.",
  "how long have you been studying LANGUAGE?",
  "let me know if you need anything else.",
  "yes he is the only left handed qb in the BUSINESS right now",
  "they might help.",
  "i don't think this is true.",
  "you ’ re unbearable, you can walk home, i ’ m leaving.",
  "groovy!",
  "it ’ s up on the second FAC.",
  "when did you bring it to us?",
  "hard to imagine actually",
  "i'm all done now.",
  "ya thats insane.",
  "i almost forget it.",
  "yes, that would be fine.",
  "i do enjoy using the PRODUCT.",
  "yep and even more impressive.",
  "oh that is pretty cool.",
  "can i do that right now?",
  "what do you think everyone was doing back then  before they created the PRODUCT?",
  "yes and there's PRODUCT service there as well.",
  "i've seen a little of it before turning it off.",
  "i must weigh it first.",
  "i suppose that they would oblige you.",
  "whenever is suitable for you.",
  "that is reassuring as well.",
  "wow. did not know that.",
  "i prefer ANIMAL.",
  "i am not sure what that means.",
  "i thought the starting OCCUPATION is too low.",
  "who is the OCCUPATION?",
  "yes, certainly, madam.",
  "i do like reading!",
  "well, i guess on friday, then you can eat.",
  "depends on how respectful it's done.",
  "i used to play but now i think i have mostly forgotten.",
  "i'm going to try to find out where the LOCATION is located.",
  "how is that?",
  "i had the under too!",
  "i think i have heard of that before.",
  "that was PRODUCT 6, right?",
  "i suppose the local one.",
  "no. who is in that? is that about PERSON?",
  "i've heard.",
  "i actually looked that up because i had wondered myself what it represented.",
  "yeah but he did it before when he went to LOCATION so it shouldn't surprise anybody.",
  "i won ’ t be needing anything else.",
  "that comes to h.k. $ 120.",
  "dogs are awesome!",
  "although you probably should not listen to it.",
  "you can do that with any other social PRODUCT as well.",
  "but it's very tired.",
  "wow i didn't know the BUSINESS was that old.",
  "that just does not sound right.",
  "we will transact this for you as soon as we can after the PRODUCT you have given me have been checked and verified.",
  "thank you so much for shopping here.",
  "yes i mentioned that earlier.",
  "that ’ s not bad at all.",
  "$ 12.",
  "whoa, when.",
  "sounds like they were or are.",
  "did you register yet?",
  "yeah, but nothing was clear during the SPORTS_EVENT.",
  "where is she from?",
  "that's very expensive!",
  "yeah he did that was very unfortunate.",
  "they are pony.",
  "we don't have much PRODUCT left.",
  "that's so strange.",
  "it's astonishing.",
  "i've wondered that as well.",
  "thank you, but no.",
  "i'm sure you'll do fine if you try your best.",
  "funny!",
  "WORK_OF_ART and pencils!",
  "no, really.",
  "i wonder what that is for though.",
  "it was actually.",
  "ok, but they better tag lightly!",
  "yeah i can't believe they were able to develop that!",
  "yes, okay.",
  "i think PERSON narrated as well.",
  "predicted.",
  "never really got into them but always meant to.",
  "consider yourself lucky.",
  "that's exactly what i was thinking had happened.",
  "these are some PRODUCT.",
  "ridiculous!",
  "i enjoy WORK_OF_ART like that.",
  "why didn ’ t you just stay at BUSINESS?",
  "have you ever used the PRODUCT?",
  "thats pretty awesome.",
  "you're embarrassed, aren't you?",
  "ah, there's something in what you're saying.",
  "they are really amazing.",
  "it's not just that.",
  "no i saw that he made PRODUCT mainly blue since he can't see green or red.",
  "they are scary too.",
  "i am kind of confused.",
  "ok.don ’ t let it get to you.",
  "that's quite a few.",
  "they are cool.",
  "if that's okay with you.",
  "that's why i am going to leave.",
  "yeah that would be good.",
  "well, maybe.",
  "don't be so sure.",
  "yep it sounds like it.",
  "i would like to visit that BUSINESS.",
  "i'll take two more, a red one and a white one.",
  "depends on how you communicate i guess.",
  "i ’ m relieved to hear that.",
  "yeah that is just too cute ho they can sense that and react to it",
  "i'm interested in who wins.",
  "i was.",
  "i'm not sure about that.",
  "8 pm, that's fine with me.",
  "i'm guilty of not doing that myself.",
  "i just love everything about it!",
  "i have not actually.",

  "some are not small.",
  "i would definitely lose.",
  "well, let's see.",
  "i know right... me too....",
  "it's too small for me to wear.",
  "he won a LAW in 1953.",
  "yes he did not earn a LAW!",
  "ya it's only about 3 PRODUCT thick.",
  "yes i don't know why it has not taken off in LOCATION.",
  "i know you're right, but what can i do?",
  "i think you ’ re right.",
  "give me your PRODUCT, would you?",
  "i don't agree with much of his NORP either.",
  "i think i read about that a while back.",
  "i would hope so too!",
  "i can't imagine it's helpful.",
  "yeah,",
  "i honestly hadn't either.",
  "at LOCATION.",
  "i hope you're right.",

  "that is interesting as well!",
  "that is astonishing.",
  "i have heard my ORG rant and rave about it.",
  "that would be fun to ride.",
  "they're related to one another, yes.",
  "no. didnt know that.",
  "i'd be okay with that.",
  "i am going to go look into that right now.",
  "it ’ s going to be $ 5.",
  "i'm engaged in ACADEMIC_DISCIPLINE.",
  "that's very important.",
  "i am really not sure.",
  "i just remembered.",
  "not in particular.",
  "i saw it and i recommend it.",
  "i know pretty funny.",
  "foxtrot.",
  "ok, i am going to the BUSINESS to pick you up.",
  "yeah they have both become really big.",
  "yes that is true i agree with you on that.",
  "it's tough PRODUCT.",
  "oh that is terrible.",
  "well, i ’ m glad to hear it.",
  "i think they are quite reasonable, and the FOOD are very fresh.",
  "he probably did.",
  "not really no.",
  "i honestly don't know much about the LOCATION.",
  "indeed they would.",
  "it will make for an interesting EVENT in 2020.",
  "that  seems kind of invasive.",
  "i don't understand",
  "but PRODUCT are quite seaworthy.",
  "tell me which building it's in.",
  "ya thats true.",
  "yeah that is so surprising and hard to believe!",
  "it would be a suitable LAW for him.",
  "they use a PRODUCT.",
  "PERSON was one of them.",
  "well, now you know.",
  "yeah and they were even nominated for 9 OCCUPATION",
  "tarzan.",
  "that would be nuts.",
  "they fly too.",
  "ahhh..  i forgot about those!",
  "i bet they do if they exist.",
  "we will be there!",
  "yay!",
  "ya it was PERSON.",
  "only $9 is that true?",
  "i'm sure that is what it was.",
  "woah!",
  "i think it has to do with where your at.",
  "he hasn't won twenty",
  "it seems like they have it tough.",
  "are you planning on going to the FAC to watch it?",
  "no, that's not good either.",
  "ah yes i used to watch those.",
  "it doesn't say.",
  "it wouldn't be full right now, would it?",
  "those are tough WORK_OF_ART!",
  "great talking to you have a good one.",
  "i dont even want to think about that!",
  "i don't know about better.",
  "more than 80% of the LOCATION are gone.",
  "that would be scary but entertaining to see on the LOCATION.",
  "you said it!",
  "i think i heard that before.",
  "i think i may try something new then!",
  "they already exist....",
  "uh...",
  "that is not as long ago as i would have thought!",
  "if they do.",
  "i bet it's pretty high.",
  "LOCATION is lovely.",
  "i don't think so either.",
  "that sounds like it could be pretty cool i might have to try that!",
  "hopefully i live long enough to find out!",
  "i'd love to, but i don't care for skating very much.",
  "i'm sure they were.",
  "i'm not sure what you mean.",
  "oh interesting i always wondered about that.",
  "oh okay i understand.",
  "as sad as it makes me i think he has a EVENT to be reelected.",
  "i have never tried.",
  "ok.let's do it.",
  "will it shrink when washed?",
  "i used to know how to play the PRODUCT when i was 10.",
  "i'm surprised that there's only one left-handed qb in the BUSINESS.",
  "i see, and what about the PRODUCT?",
  "i don't think there will be.",
  "yeah and only because it looks funny.",
  "i think i know that.",
  "it's red.",
  "not sure what was wrong with it.",
  "i'll do likewise.",
  "i know it's awkward, but you're going to be thanking me later.",
  "spider-man!",
  "my immediate ORG is very large.",
  "that was an epic WORK_OF_ART.",
  "i wonder who cleans up after the ANIMAL.",
  "that would be so useful!",
  "that sounds like me.",
  "i ’ d just like to trim.",
  "that is interesting for sure.",
  "oh that will be fun.",
  "ya i need to check those out are they any good?",
  "do you like it better here or at BUSINESS?",
  "let's go to queue up.",
  "how long have you lived here?",
  "it mst be TYPE_OF_SPORT.",
  "ah nice that is awesome and sounds like something they would do.",
  "i wonder if they could read it while dancing.",
  "jess?",
  "PRODUCT is also extremely dangerous!",
  "yeah, it's really convenient.",
  "that's strange.",
  "this is good to go.",
  "very interesting WORK_OF_ART.",
  "i find that surprising!",
  "PERSON it says.",
  "do you know how many they have?",
  "i bet it would look very weird to us.",
  "i ’ m so jealous.",
  "fantastic!",
  "can you tell me how much that'll cost?",
  "but he is really good.",
  "i'll use my PRODUCT, if that's okay.",
  "i know it  is a very popular TYPE_OF_SPORT",
  "i guess he did.",
  "i could probably pull it off.",
  "ya that would be wild.",
  "ahh that's interesting too.",
  "that happened quickly!",
  "it was almost too good to believe.",
  "i do not like his MUSIC_GENRE.",
  "i  would like to have one of those ANIMAL for sure.",
  "when did you get that?",
  "yeah you can burn more than 180 FOOD so it can be entertaining and also healthy.",
  "i would have never thought that.",
  "do you know how it started?the WORK_OF_ART is actually pretty ironic",
  "i am thinking before the PRODUCT.",
  "i respect that.",
  "we'll give you about 3000 to start.",
  "yeah i don't like to think about ACADEMIC_DISCIPLINE too much because it's so depressing.",
  "yeah it's shocking that they were fining PERSON.",
  "they were probably excited that they wouldnt have to ride ANIMAL anymore.",
  "i was when i was younger.",
  "ok, well, that ’ s all i need to know for now.",
  "you should.",
  "that's one legendary PRODUCT.",
  "they were amazing.",
  "would you mind showing me how to use it?",
  "daaaang!",
  "thank you for such a lovely EVENT!",
  "it's his 50th EVENT.",
  "i have to concur.",
  "here, i'll break them up, so they're smaller.",
  "it is odd.",
  "right she deserves it she is entertaining.",
  "i dont really know.",
  "it started before PERSON.",
  "yeah i don't know about that.",
  "you know that's good.",
  "he really was.",
  "what curb PRODUCT?",
  "that is crazy to me.",
  "it is surprising they are relatively new.",
  "PRODUCT have come so far.",
  "she is really funny.",
  "i would like to deposit $ 300.",
  "yep he is talented",
  "well, i guess i will have to drive back down then.",
  "i think it's dangerous.",
  "i do not unfortunately for now.",
  "yes, this coming saturday.",
  "i've heard of those FOOD before.",
  "how cool!",
  "it is a complex cognitive ACADEMIC_DISCIPLINE.",
  "mr. PERSON.",
  "the first is why you choose our BUSINESS?",
  "i did not see that either.",
  "i'll have a go.",
  "have you got your LAW yet?",
  "we could use it in many of the big LOCATION.",
  "that sounds good as well.",
  "she was awesome!",
  "it wouldnt.",
  "but this does tie back to the s LOCATION angle.",
  "i am surprised as well.",
  "i never saw that",
  "i agree it does.",
  "it still amazed me.",
  "i'm not going anywhere until later, so i'll clean it then.",
  "have you bought anything up to BUSINESS?",
  "you can transfer ASSOCIATION_FOOTBALL_CLUB.",
  "i do like them!",
  "i bit.",
  "that ’ s almost perfect.",
  "well if so.you should contact with the ORG over there.",
  "didn't know.",
  "i know it's like j-walking.",
  "it is really powerful.",
  "yuk.",
  "i guess you get what you pay for.",
  "i can not blame them for being cautious.",
  "i think maybe he's done some good in that LOCATION.",
  "that seems pretty reasonable.",
  "i have never heard of it being called that!",
  "may i carry this PRODUCT?",
  "well-endowed?",
  "that ’ s very interesting.",
  "oh, i like PRODUCT!",
  "i am sure it does.",
  "where are you going to get it from?",
  "yeah i think up there it is really popular.",
  "if it is bigger i'm sure you can.",
  "yes. lets hope that gets better.",
  "apparently the PRODUCT was only discontinued in september of 2003.",
  "oh i am sure.",
  "i want to say in the early 2000 but not sure exactly.",
  "that's new PRODUCT to me!",
  "yes they own 86% of it but it is all LOCATION anyways",
  "i dont know how that works.",
  "i'm sure it can.",
  "it's not that bad.",
  "he worked on west side story right?",
  "i do agree.",
  "i wish i could, but i won't.",
  "indeed he is!",
  "i watched most of it.",
  "i've already seen nine of them and, as they say, eight is enough!",
  "sorry, $ 14 is the lowest i can go.",
  "i thought he got divorced?",
  "i was surprised to hear that too.",
  "its so different now.",
  "do you listen to MUSIC_GENRE when you are driving?",
  "no, really, i think you'd like it.",
  "i'm afraid it wasn't.",
  "it would definitely make it interesting.",
  "that's exactly when i'll be away.",
  "sometimes they do and sometimes not.",
  "that is just funny.",
  "yeah, i guess i am.",
  "hmm i'm not sure.",
  "pretty busy.",
  "what is it that you need to do?",
  "and apparently it works.",
  "it's often cold in december, january and february.",
  "i just burst out laughing!!",
  "i believe in the late 19th WORK_OF_ART.",
  "i see as well as understand better now.",
  "and then, what should we do next when you meet the ORG?",
  "i have never been to LOCATION.",
  "plus PRODUCT?",
  "yes. agreed.",
  "how about milan?",
  "they win.",
  "saturday, july 25.",
  "he sounds like a nice OCCUPATION.",
  "yeah but i feel like they would need to use some complex PRODUCT.",
  "oh that is nice then.",
  "i've heard that as well.",
  "sounds like both are really smart.",
  "no i actually don't know that.",
  "that's crazy they just used wooden PRODUCT.",
  "and would you like anything to drink?",
  "yes, would you please tell her PERSON called?",
  "very surprising.",
  "that is... bizarre.",
  "i wonder if that would really be effective now though.",
  "let me look at the PRODUCT.",
  "yes, that's it.",
  "why the soviet union?",
  "yes and then he gets $32 million after that",
  "yeah, let's do that.",
  "did you call the ORG?",
  "not quite the only one.",
  "you are really tough.",
  "i actually never seen any of them either.",
  "what the????",
  "that sounds kind of boring.",
  "it is amazing how faster PRODUCT are.",
  "that is so funny i would love to see that.",
  "yes, but i think it's probably for the best.",
  "that would be nice to find out!",
  "i actually heard that.",
  "do you have a specific PRODUCT you'd like to see?",
  "just difficult to believe.",
  "yeah they did that was great WORK_OF_ART!",
  "how do i get there.",
  "how has it gotten so twisted then?",
  "what is the funny vote?",
  "your id PRODUCT, please.",
  "that's something i wouldn't do though.",
  "i wouldn't have guessed that.",
  "it's on the second FAC.",
  "they look all right to me.",
  "i would have loved to have seen that.",
  "i think it might be interesting.",
  "and maybe some of them are better left out.",
  "good, i hope you'll make sure that it won't happen again.",
  "oh ok thats cool.",
  "i wonder if you can change it to one PRODUCT down.",
  "BUSINESS... ?",
  "well, live and learn.",
  "it's not what i asked for.",
  "so why did you decide to resign?",
  "yep... great chat... have a good one!",
  "it actually doesn't surprise me.",
  "it sure is.",
  "where have you gone in LOCATION?i would love to go there too.",
  "never really know what they're up to. though!",
  "i know i enjoyed it over here.",
  "she certainly does.",
  "i'd like both.",
  "my FOOD are very soggy.",
  "your front PRODUCT is just as damaged.",
  "i didn't watch it either.",
  "that's excellent.",
  "which one would you recommend?",
  "yes, i can get it for you",
  "yes, sir, it's $ 20.",
  "yeah, that sounds delicious.",
  "that's 886.",
  "it must have been really frustrating.",
  "yes he truly was gifted.",

  "i really don't think that i did that.",
  "that's it?",
  "wow so many awards!",
  "ok.dose it include FOOD?",
  "i used to .",
  "it is allowed now.",
  "i am probably overthinking this.",
  "oh that's right!",
  "how can i find out if i can collect?",
  "not where, what.",
  "i am really proud of you.",
  "where is the coolest LOCATION you've traveled?",
  "what SPORT_TEAM did he play for?",
  "i'm afraid yes.",
  "you have been in LOCATION, hadn't you?",
  "yes, everything has been well designed.",
  "i don't remember that.",
  "it's rather more than i was thinking of paying.",
  "they are smarter than we make them to be",
  "let's go there then.",
  "indeed they were!",
  "i never noticed either.",
  "i've never seen a WORK_OF_ART.",
  "well, you'll just have to wait.",
  "yeah i used to go more often.",
  "wow thats pretty cool.",
  "did i?",
  "as suppose you reback at 10",
  "except one",
  "very fitting.",
  "they must be really bad.",
  "here's 30.",
  "yes - there is this awesome PRODUCT where you can listen to them for free.",
  "about 15.",
  "darn!!",
  "oh, it's quite all right, i suppose.",
  "well, first you have to turn this PRODUCT on.",
  "i really appreciate you for having invited me.",
  "i think i will too.",
  "what do they call them?",
  "i guess i'm lending them to you...",
  "ya i think it was like 32 million when he gets to be 55.",
  "i wonder what that sounds like.",
  "they're also way younger than us.",
  "i had those WORK_OF_ART of late fee's sometimes.",
  "i guess if possible it could be in LOCATION.",
  "would you like me to come get you when the FOOD is done?",
  "they are a little like ORG.",
  "i think i will.",
  "i doubt that.",
  "yeah i think they are living in their own little LOCATION.",
  "at least he didn't take the $22 million he was entitled to receive.",
  "yeah its not scary.",
  "maybe you ’ re right.",
  "yeah love the simpsons!",
  "i ’ m jealous.",
  "yeah i have a PRODUCT.",
  "the PRODUCT is getting pretty technical.",
  "8.5 is correct.",
  "let ’ s get both.",
  "this is an especially famous one.",
  "if i were him.",
  "sure and which one would you like?",
  "got it.",
  "i agree on that one.",
  "hhahahaaa!",
  "it was fun.",
  "oh interesting i didn't hear about that.",
  "oh, i haven ’ t noticed that before.",
  "yes and that is how he qualified to be a professional OCCUPATION",
  "i ’ m pretty happy living there.",
  "i think so .",
  "ok.i have written it down.",
  "me too, but i think we shouldn't drink too much of it, as it's not very healthy.",
  "i would.",
  "it's just what i want.",
  "that never works!",
  "LOCATION could sure benefit from one too.",
  "that was cool of them.",
  "in the SPORTS_SEASON.",
  "i listen to PRODUCT more.",
  "yes they really seem to.",
  "i should have known...",
  "yes i will!",
  "probably because its faster to get around on.",
  "fine, thank you, and you?",
  "if you'll just fill out this PRODUCT, please.",
  "yes it sounds very scary to live there.",
  "that sounds great!",
  "you should try to go to one someday.",
  "did you ever have an PRODUCT?",
  "no, just occasionally",
  "that ' for sure but very few.",
  "don't mistake her as somebody.",
  "well i don't know exactly.",
  "kk?",
  "it is a good PRODUCT for that.",
  "you seem excited about it.",
  "it's random.",
  "yeah, i think so.",
  "but it's kind of crazy.",
  "thank you it was great chatting with you too!",
  "it ’ s that really necessary?",
  "yeah those ORG are nuts.",
  "oh, so bad.",
  "wasn't he amazing!",
  "i dont know.",
  "yes i have heard that they'll make fake WORK_OF_ART.",
  "that's kinda strange.",
  "i was shocked by that too.",
  "do it, please.",
  "no PRODUCT.",
  "yeah he was called OCCUPATION.",
  "in 1975.",
  "i use PRODUCT...",
  "they are by new PRODUCT now, they are not very expensive.",
  "that's excellent!",
  "good news for us.",
  "only at LOCATION.",
  "that's what i've heard.",
  "no only in zoos.",
  "i can if you like.",
  "that's nuts.",
  "oh i remember now.",
  "wow, you're right.",
  "well, not fully automated.",
  "how long do you have to be there?",
  "interesting.",
  "that ’ s why WORK_OF_ART need to be realistic.",
  "yes and i don't know.",
  "i didn't know until just now.",
  "i would have liked to hear the LAW.",
  "no i actually haven't.",
  "i hope they are.",
  "oh, it's a beautiful LOCATION.",
  "yes that is very interesting.",
  "i wonder what it tasted like.",
  "that is crazy they were in the SPORTS_EVENT!",
  "oh, let me think...",
  "i no longer watch it.",
  "ya they are amazing.",
  "6850 PRODUCT.",
  "ya i don't blame you.",
  "i didn't know that was still going on.",
  "they're right upstairs.",
  "i have to say that i find it refreshing to hear you say this.",
  "i am looking.",
  "it's not worth dealing with all the ORG!",
  "that's funny they were sued.",
  "men!",
  "i am going to miss you, too.",
  "they sent them a WORK_OF_ART saying.",
  "i hate the ORG but i have to give it to them.",
  "i wonder how one earns that nickname/",
  "maybe that ’ s what i'll do.",
  "just about everything.",
  "seems a little childish to threaten to sue them.",
  "ok.thank you very much.",
  "yes, he knows i'm coming.",
  "oh thats too bad.",
  "he was definitely beyond qualified to be a OCCUPATION.",
  "very impressive indeed.",
  "i have never even heard of him.",
  "i've never leased before.",
  "that is really nice of them!",
  "yes, it's ok.",
  "yeah but, how did this EVENT come to be?",
  "i did lol.",
  "because it's supposed to be good for you.",
  "he sure was stylish.",
  "never fumbled?",
  "qi in is.",
  "that does seem very strange.",
  "ya that is shocking.",
  "it was horrible!",
  "did he hurt you?",
  "no, i am afraid the FAC isn ’ t permitted.",
  "i suppose i don't want that one then.",
  "here we go.",
  "that's interesting",
  "where are you living now?",
  "i can imagine that was bittersweet for him then.",
  "carton?",
  "the POLITICAL_PARTY.",
  "he must have used it too much.",
  "i will look into it too!",
  "no, and i haven ’ t done anything out of the ordinary.",
  "that's tragic.",
  "i bet he likes to get good and scared!",
  "i think i would rather listen to ORG.",
  "i'm not surprised",
  "i myself never knew that.",
  "amazing !",
  "fine, thank you very much.",
  "ah interesting i'll have to check those out.",
  "wow!",
  "i want to invite you to enjoy the FOOD i cook.",
  "i wonder how he feels about that?",
  "ya i might actually go see his EVENT.",
  "that would be neat to see!",
  "yeah that would be hard.",
  "what should i do?",
  "that's valid.",
  "i don ' t think so.",
  "so you don't like any WORK_OF_ART?",
  "you won't have to pay for anything.",
  "good for him i guess.",
  "same here!",
  "well it has been lovely to speak with you.",
  "yeah i  wonder though if that means something else too in their LANGUAGE",
  "that is what i was taught in LOCATION.",
  "when you're thirsty, you're not supposed to drink FOOD.",
  "yeah, but it's expensive.",
  "maybe there is.",
  "i thought it was funny too.",
  "you never cook.",
  "not at all!",
  "hmm actually i do not know that.",
  "very true again.",
  "yeah that is correct.",
  "that is what i was thinking too!",
  "it really hurts.",
  "i guess it is at that.",
  "do you need anything else, sir?",
  "i didnt realized he had any at all.",
  "i would just learn about it by reading rather than watching.",
  "nope i do not .",
  "oh that would certainly help!",
  "yes, we agreed to that.",
  "i'm embarrassed!",
  "oh, now i understand!",
  "i have never listened to BUSINESS.",
  "now i definitely never heard that one before... wonder if it looks like PRODUCT?",
  "i agree with you.",
  "oh, it is conveniently located, isn't it?",
  "i believe that.",
  "your id, please.",
  "i do like reading.",
  "i have and i love it.",
  "quite possibly.",
  "they must...except maybe in LOCATION.",
  "how much would you like to change?",
  "ANIMAL have 'eureka moments' and enjoy the experience of solving a problem in order to obtain a reward.",
  "i bet it's hilarious.",
  "i saw that too lol.",
  "thats pretty ironic actually.",
  "yes, orange juice will be fine for me.",
  "sounds like a EVENT.",
  "i used to have a ANIMAL.",
  "i can't believe that.",
  "the polish composer?",
  "isn't that u believable?",
  "i work here.",
  "yes and strangely enough he is not even mentioned in it at all",
  "funny guy!",
  "that's really surprising!!",
  "it's not far away from LOCATION, it's - let me see – about 20 minutes'walk, can you walk here?",
  "yes he played TYPE_OF_SPORT back in 1983 i think.",
  "yes in men's TYPE_OF_SPORT.",
  "if they had an unpleasant FOOD.",
  "depends on with whom.",
  "not usually!",
  "i can always use my PRODUCT to get in, but i would prefer that you be there.",
  "what happened?",
  "yeah, around seven.",
  "it looks like it was cancelled after 10 WORK_OF_ART.",
  "wow i wonder if thats personal.",
  "yeah LOCATION is peculiar.",
  "why not try it on?",
  "i agree ha.",
  "i personally fall into the 7%.",
  "wow, that must have really been scary.",
  "no, not at all!",
  "not too near but not too far either.",
  "those PRODUCT were really cool.",
  "you ’ ll be okay.",
  "yes you as well",
  "i am so sorry, madam!",
  "they were their own WORK_OF_ART.",
  "well, there's nothing very much wrong with you, i'm glad to say.",
  "are you looking for a casual PRODUCT or something formal?",
  "that is pretty optomistic.",
  "i haven't but it does seem plausible.",
  "but you know if he brought it or not, right?",
  "i'm with you.",
  "and short LANGUAGE.",
  "are you sure these are the only open LOCATION?",
  "i am in LOCATION where it is -20",
  "no i dint know that the only LOCATION really?",
  "yeah they wear them because they are allowed to play if it need be",
  "can i have my PRODUCT back now?",
  "yes i have seen it.",
  "yes that was i  but not sure what happened to it",
  "so did i.",
  "would you like to go now or later?",
  "i bet he did as well.",
  "hmm i am not sure.",
  "that's something i don't know anything about.",
  "definitely such an amazing WORK_OF_ART.",
  "for me i had to go real slow.",
  "i have yes.",
  "yes i live in LOCATION.",
  "he is still a great TYPE_OF_SPORT.",
  "TYPE_OF_SPORT.",
  "that is sad.",
  "they found a PRODUCT?",
  "i am not surprised to hear that at all actually.",
  "i remember it being funny but that's about all i remember.",
  "they are not bad.",
  "oh, i'm not sure i agree with you.",
  "i didn't know they could learn so many LANGUAGE!",
  "i loved it.",
  "yes. have a good one",
  "i should.",
  "you mean you haven ’ t seen her before?",
  "i wonder if there is ORG that keep watching them.",
  "that's for sure.",
  "looks good!",
  "ok, you mean the vacant one on the LOCATION?",
  "hopefully it stays safe!",
  "i tend to think he received it fairly positively.",
  "okay, i think that i understand.",
  "that is pretty amazing!",
  "it does!",
  "she's going to be so happy.",
  "can i FOOD you anything to drink? :",
  "i agree with you there!",
  "it probably is in LOCATION for certain.",
  "interesting one.",
  "oh that's disappointing.",
  "the incredibles?",
  "i haven't seen them!",
  "thats so interesting also.",
  "i think they lean NORP.",
  "it would not surprise me.",
  "why did you choose to study ACADEMIC_DISCIPLINE?",
  "did you know we're trying to talk him into considering a presidential EVENT?",
  "just make sure to tell me beforehand.",
  "i wonder if PERSON took them off.",
  "ya i remember seeing that.",
  "i don't know but i'm going to have to look.",
  "its something called the PRODUCT.",
  "i have to say she is so pretty",
  "so won ’ t you come down any more?",
  "i mean he is only 43.",
  "i'm sure they probably do.",
  "did you play PRODUCT?",
  "they sure do!",
  "regarding what exactly?",
  "that is interesting too.",
  "hmm.. will PRODUCT work?",
  "oh i see that explains it!",
  "it is awesome that MUSIC_GENRE is played all over.",
  "does that happen when they are domesticated?",
  "ha ha i am thinking the latter would be more realistic.",
  "it's amazing that BUSINESS was founded back in 1994.",
  "it's located right under our FAC.",
  "it seems like it would be called that.",
  "yes, we did.",
  "that ’ s bogus.",

  "i would find it hilarious.",
  "i couldn't agree more.",
  "that'd be great!",
  "i haven't seen that one.",
  "there probably weren't any political POLITICAL_PARTY back then.",
  "that would be pretty expensive i would think!",
  "being famous, i can do without, but i wouldn't mind being rich.",
  "i guess it is.",
  "i'm not good at playing PRODUCT",

  "that sounds like it could be very interesting.",
  "seems very painful.",
  "probably... but who cares.",
  "it was fun talking with you as well!",
  "there was nowhere to park, and i needed to run in and get something.",
  "its a really funny movie.do you like PERSON?",
  "i'll think about it after i start feeling better.",
  "so interesting.",
  "i actually wonder if that's still true.",
  "that is very surprising.",
  "i have to get going.",
  "can i test it out?",
  "would you like an extra PRODUCT?",
  "unfortunately, yes.",
  "i don't know much about his NORP.",
  "i would be really curious to see what it is like there for sure!",

  "i think the LOCATION is livelier.",
  "that's ok.",
  "i do listen to them!",
  "i cannot remember it actually.",
  "yeah i find that weird too.",
  "very funny.",
  "no, i don't, but i like FOOD.",

  "probably in hot LOCATION.",
  "yes i would think that too",
  "no i didn't even know she remade it.",
  "please, you write much better than i do.",
  "oh man!",
  "yeah i wondered about that too.",
  "they are staying at BUSINESS.",
  "it should also be truthful and realistic.",
  "he is opposed to FOOD!",
  "and i suppose i can do that anywhere?",
  "i like TYPE_OF_SPORT but don't really follow it.",
  "it could be that, or maybe you are eating too many FOOD.",
  "i ’ d totally die if she turned me down.",
  "i'll bet.",
  "charge it to whatever account you like.",
  "would you like to exchange it?",
  "i will fix it for you.",
  "radio is great!",
  "what about PERSON?",
  "what have you been up to?",
  "really...",
  "sounds boring to me.",
  "so if you want to meet at 10",
  "yes, but not fluently.",
  "i wanted to, but i knew that if i spoke to her, i'd just blow up at her, so i decided to just go home.",
  "yep that's really cool.",
  "yeah i guess that doesnt surprise me at all.",
  "that's what i thought too.",
  "quite good except thinking of you so much.",
  "you are using the PRODUCT right now though.",
  "whoa he must be very tough.",
  "they do get along.",
  "it's ok.",
  "that does not sit well with me .",
  "that seem so strange.",
  "well, sounds very attractive.",
  "yeah that's very impressive!",
  "i wonder what he ordered?",
  "i never knew him until WORK_OF_ART.",
  "that's outrageous.",
  "i should but would not know where to even start.",
  "yeah considering it is bigger than FAC",
  "i i love the BUSINESS too.",
  "well, ok.",
  "now you know.",
  "why did you transfer?",
  "i've just contacted our ORG.",
  "yeah that i can see getting expensive.",
  "and you want to know what to wear?",
  "ah i'll have to check that out.",
  "i've finished.",
  "bam!",
  "8 years!",
  "but i don't speak LANGUAGE at all.",
  "i like that we should adopt it for the other LOCATION as well.",
  "wow i wonder if they will manage to do that eventually.",
  "what do you mean by that?",
  "don't play hard to get.",
  "i don't know how i feel about BUSINESS.",
  "yeah that could be traumatizing.",
  "there was.",
  "it might help.",
  "yes, i get it.",
  "thank you, they ’ re beautiful.",
  "oh man i wonder what that sounds like.",
  "i'm curious to that as well.",
  "so hard to choose.",
  "they seen to be indeed.",
  "i've never looked for the hidden WORK_OF_ART.",
  "not at all, but we don ’ t have a very traditional NORP either, so it suited us perfectly!",
  "yes i have a small ANIMAL.",
  "must have had excellent PRODUCT!",
  "do you have your driver's LAW?",
  "i enjoyed it, even though i had not asked for it.",
  "yes, we won't travel again until october.",
  "i think that i will.",
  "i'll have to look those up.",
  "i agree wholeheartedly.",
  "i think that is ACADEMIC_DISCIPLINE.",
  "i'll check them out.",
  "that is something i did not know.",
  "if you stay off your PRODUCT for a while.",
  "i am not sure if there was a sequal or not.",
  "oh yes i did hear that PERSON.",
  "it's been nice chatting with you too.",
  "i would never have guessed that one.",
  "that's probably for the best.",
  "well that is impressive.",
  "must have been.",
  "i wonder how he divided them.",
  "i hope so...",
  "theres a ORG there?",
  "i wonder why he put it on a LOCATION though.",
  "i hope that works.",
  "yes, i agree with you.",
  "yeah she does.",
  "i just figured everyone knew that is what they are selling.",
  "that's great to hear.",
  "the FOOD there is actually pretty good.",
  "i heard that as well.",
  "... i am seeing someone.",
  "that's impressive for them.",
  "it was banned?",
  "i do remember watching him play!",
  "it is so young.",
  "but either he or the OCCUPATION picked some that are just right.",
  "fine, see you then.",
  "yes i heard about that too",
  "i haven't seen that yet.",
  "shall we bring any PRODUCT?",
  "which makes me wonder.",
  "that's kind of you to say.",
  "i've never tried e-PRODUCT.",
  "i thought about that.",
  "it was a PRODUCT.",
  "wow i cannot see how",
  "they may.",
  "i dont even know what else they air.",
  "oh, it will be so expensive!",
  "i'll have to look that up.",
  "i am sure they are!",
  "i hope you're hungry because the FOOD here is huge as well as to die for.",
  "i've never visited but i've heard that before.",
  "i cant even do that now.",
  "that is a tough one.",
  "yeah he died in 1891.",
  "do you use PRODUCT much?",
  "myspace is dead!",
  "very true",
  "they are $ 168.",
  "he is very talented.",
  "sadly i did not.",
  "i'm sure he did.",
  "which FOOD do you use for?",
  "thats sad to think about.",
  "probably pretty comfortable for sure!",
  "i'm sure they pay very well.",
  "hmmm not sure.",
  "there was no WORK_OF_ART taken, so i'll let you go.",
  "he definitely knows what WORK_OF_ART is.",
  "i want the best.",
  "yes, it's not too bad.",
  "then i'll see you at six.",
  "did they have FOOD?",
  "they must have amazingly strong!",
  "more than i should",
  "she seems to be quite qualified.",
  "yeah i agree.",
  "i also respect that.",
  "so how do you intend to do that?",
  "that's quite a WORK_OF_ART!",
  "no. not particularly.",
  "i am flattered.",
  "i couldn't figure that out either!",
  "yes i had heard that",
  "yeah that is probably true.",
  "it has.",
  "it is but nobody does it like we do!",
  "see.",
  "do you like PERSON though?",
  "ya they're so smart.",
  "his NORP are astronomical.",
  "i guess it was because of his \"cultural WORK_OF_ART.\"",
  "in the WORK_OF_ART.",
  "it makes you wonder what happened that initially prompted that LAW to be instituted?",
  "that makes for something super interesting.",
  "i know it sure does.",
  "i also listen to PRODUCT to.",
  "oh sounds nice.",
  "no, is it difficult?",
  "i know several.",
  "i do know him!",
  "i mean it is cool to get a FAC named after you.",
  "it seems like he was a staunch NORP.",
  "very popular PRODUCT.",
  "no im sure he wouldnt.",
  "i should PRODUCT to find out more about it.",
  "oh, its nothing.",
  "since he wont release his PRODUCT.",
  "i'm so hungry, i could eat a whole FOOD!",
  "there's always BUSINESS.",
  "i remember in the WORK_OF_ART.",
  "i think will get there eventually.",
  "no joke!",
  "that is funny how someone became rich over something like that.",
  "i never knew that either.",
  "it's an excellent BUSINESS.",
  "i dont know maybe.",
  "what was interesting about it?",
  "you can always go home and make something to eat.",
  "i agree that is so terrible!",
  "they're quite nice.",
  "lol yup.",
  "i do like shopping on PRODUCT but i always don't like what i get.",
  "i guess i misjudged you.",
  "amen!",
  "i hope to go there someday.",
  "that amazes me.",
  "i would love to go there.",
  "yeah that's why i don't understand how they can do that.",
  "ok.i like that green FOOD",
  "yeah that would be horrible.",
  "i guess they make out pretty good!",
  "i think i remember that happening.",
  "i've been invited over to a friend's, and you?",
  "but i won't let you do that.",
  "yeah i have tried that before and it is really good i would agree!",
  "yes it was a great one.",
  "i heard LOCATION believes that too!",
  "ok, great, should i bring anything?",
  "i wonder how that works.",
  "i have to go now.",
  "i like it",
  "i think it was popular.",
  "yeah its pretty funny.",
  "i think i have read about them doing that.",
  "i suppose they are socially and economically conservative.",
  "if you turn it to am.",
  "yeah and in other 86 LOCATION.",
  "do you know how much they are paying her?",
  "it ’ s really not necessary.",
  "yeah very creative.",
  "it must not have translated well culturally.",
  "i heard it was a WORK_OF_ART too.",
  "true it hasn't happened often.",
  "boy, oh boy!",
  "i didnt know about that either.",
  "i didn't lie.",
  "imagine how much he'd have now?",
  "i think they do actually!",
  "yep. which is really cool.",
  "yeah...",
  "indeed it is!",
  "very popular.",
  "yes, i've heard about that.",
  "i don't know but i imagine it's a very high pitched MUSIC_GENRE.",
  "yeah it is pretty neat.",
  "ya that sounds weird and funny!",
  "they aren't hard.",
  "i would definitely be confused.",
  "i have noticed that.",
  "isn't that stupid?",
  "that is cool.",
  "i'll come prepared.",
  "i dont know if i would go that far.",
  "yes that is surprising.",
  "wow that is a little too much i think.",
  "not sure what you mean .",
  "i guess looking back that it could be quite traumatizing.",
  "isn't that cool!",
  "i wonder why you would want to surgically shorten a PRODUCT?",
  "yeah they are called the ORG.",
  "what PRODUCT?",
  "no but that would be interesting to hear!",
  "i've wanted to be involved in ACADEMIC_DISCIPLINE ever since i was little.",
  "the PRODUCT is very popular.",
  "i think thats funny and also ironic.",
  "last i heard he was broke!",
  "only when it's funny.",
  "i would say me too.",
  "yeah i think i read that recently.",
  "i can ’ t EVENT on tuesday.",
  "yeah, sorry.",
  "i don't!",
  "that sounds amazing!",
  "it was nice talking!",
  "we eat it in my LOCATION too, but i wouldn't say it ’ s very popular.",
  "i havent heard of them.",
  "before next friday.",
  "i'm kind of addicted to my PRODUCT.",
  "speaking of which.",
  "no i haven't heard of it either.",
  "that has helped BUSINESS greatly.",
  "yeah i guess it must.",
  "i sued to before.",
  "that is a great TYPE_OF_SPORT.",
  "you can wear more PRODUCT.",
  "sorry, not before 10 thirty.",
  "it was called the LOCATION.",
  "that's going to be about $ 2.48.",
  "wow  he really did not like the EVENT i guess.",
  "i'm somewhat familiar with that FAC but i never frequented it myself.",
  "kind of strange but ok.",
  "well, it's an automatic PRODUCT.",
  "thats is unbelievable.",
  "wow that's quite the WORK_OF_ART!",
  "it doesn't matter right now, either one would be ok.",
  "yeah that is so short yet the PRODUCT is so long.",
  "now i remember.",
  "i believe they were PERSON.",
  "yep i agree it seems stupid.",
  "i do remember that.",
  "as far as being a PRODUCT dj.",
  "i think i read that when he did that!",
  "his NATION accent is amazing.",
  "i will check those out.",
  "oh, sorry to hear that.",
  "the PRODUCT was so much better then.",
  "maybe they should go first.",
  "that sounds ideal.",
  "oh yeah we for sure have it better than other LOCATION but we should have it better than we do.",
  "yes and i thought it was pretty good.",
  "i doubt they will mess it up.",
  "its really good .",
  "she deserves it.",
  "not sure about that.",
  "it is surprising with as long as it's been on.",
  "well, i see.",
  "the PRODUCT sounds pretty complicated too.",
  "i do watch some.",
  "wow that is kind of sad.",
  "that is thoughtful.",
  "i ’ m awfully sorry to hear that.",
  "all right, just a quick one.",
  "actually it will be my first EVENT to meet her.",
  "PRODUCT are so important for that.",
  "i like private as well he is so funny.",
  "how long have you known how to do that?",
  "i know i would have never guessed it.",
  "yeah..once they figure out what you are pointing at.",
  "that i'm not sure about... don't know the exact date.",
  "but i don ’ t like them.",
  "i also like that it encourages you to recycle.",
  "looking forward to meeting with you!",
  "is skating interesting?",
  "i can't understand it.",
  "i'd like to learn as well.",
  "what do you think of PERSON?",
  "i will probably too.",
  "i remember when that was going on.",
  "why can't i call the ORG now?",
  "now that i've google PERSON to see what he looks like me neither.",
  "i dont have a smart PRODUCT.",
  "that's too bad",
  "no i haven't tried that before but sounds pretty cool.",
  "thankfully that is over and the FAC is back up and running.",
  "not so much recently.",
  "7 a. m.",
  "we haven't.",
  "i didnt know that but it would be fun to watch.",
  "that's super interesting.",
  "i wonder if that's true.",
  "yes i am not sure sounds unfair.",
  "i'll have to google that and look it up.",
  "that is just insane.",
  "oh thats good to know!",
  "and i thank you as well.",
  "ok, got it!",
  "here ’ s your $ 150.",
  "i agree that is sad.",
  "i just wish they would disappear.",
  "it's funny to think back.",
  "i recently learned that it was the fastest to dial.",
  "what was so bad about it?",
  "i liked the first two.",
  "now that im aware of but never really got into it.",
  "it was $2.500 and he was unable to pay it.",
  "that does seem convenient.",
  "you can't come any earlier than that?",
  "how about you?",
  "i think it's 20% at most.",
  "so many of those OCCUPATION were so well educated.",
  "i ’ ll remember to bring PRODUCT with me.",
  "it's probably a little of both for him.",
  "i can just imagine.",
  "yes, i hope so.",
  "ORG really respected him.",
  "i'm not very familiar with it.",
  "it sounds funny.",
  "you have?",
  "not bad, just let it go.",
  "i don't see it.",
  "a PRODUCT?",
  "i think i would if i saw something suspecious.",
  "it was different.",
  "it's good that he does this.",
  "i will say.",
  "he seems like a nice OCCUPATION.",
  "i haven't heard that one.",
  "that funny.",
  "mrs. PERSON.",
  "we'd better also leave him alone.",
  "i ’ m going on EVENT.",
  "OCCUPATION all around are surprising.",
  "while you are at it can you pick out a nice PRODUCT?",
  "i didn't play it much.",
  "i wish i had bought that BUSINESS.",
  "it is indeed!",
  "ya i still have it.",
  "probably already doing something.",
  "now it isn't.",
  "something tells me that PRODUCT is somewhat outdated.",
  "i agree with you so far.",
  "i mean, i know EVENT training's over, but i'm just not into all that.",
  "i never knew about it until recently.",
  "i would go if i were in LOCATION!",
  "it was bad.",
  "i did not know until you told me.",
  "that does seem odd to me.",
  "i would like to see that.",
  "it must be cool to bisit the PRODUCT.",
  "yes but he is slightly allergic to them ironically",
  "???",
  "it was surprising to know.",
  "PERSON is pretty cool.",
  "do you like working in ORG?",
  "i think what you wear is so overrated.",
  "classic!",
  "it's about 300 PRODUCT.",
  "i do like to read",
  "that sounds pretty good wow.",
  "according to the PRODUCT in 1994.",
  "no what is it?",
  "that's funny because i don't really see the WORK_OF_ART!",
  "it should have been, but it wasn ’ t.",
  "oh i see what you're saying now.",
  "it truly is.",
  "i'm glad he wasn't!",
  "that ’ s what i want to say.",
  "i have read that before as well.",
  "is there anything else i can do for you?",
  "i am not familiar with her.",
  "i'm so excited.",
  "well, i don't think it matches my PRODUCT.",
  "right thats true.",
  "i was going to ask what you thought about it.",
  "that is fast.",
  "that really is awesome.",
  "well apparently they have 750 WORK_OF_ART.",
  "i have a pc.",
  "if it was humorous and enjoyable i probably would",
  "tell me what you've been up to.",
  "i think maybe it's just being posted too often.",
  "i also want to pack up my PRODUCT.",
  "i've never heard about that.",
  "does he?",
  "political WORK_OF_ART is my favorite.",
  "oh heck",
  "that is all.",
  "pop.",
  "that is better than WORK_OF_ART!",
  "that's pretty typical.",
  "i hadn't heard about that before.",
  "and do you feel anything when i do this?",
  "that makes two of us.",
  "i think it's just so old that we can't trace it exactly.",
  "even though he knew how to read.",
  "i do like going to EVENT.",
  "i honestly never heard about it.",
  "that is pretty large.",
  "i don't follow the.",
  "yes, i think i can.",
  "didn't PERSON say he invented it?",
  "oh that is pretty neat.",
  "it says that it was going to be him originally but he didnt get cast.",
  "that's why it failed!",
  "i remember seeing that somewhere.",
  "it did not know that.",
  "such as...",
  "yeah it is outdated and it needs to go by now",
  "later :)",
  "well, i ‘ d certainly come and visit you.",
  "that sounds like a good one.",
  "yeah that was too bad.",
  "it's really nice.",
  "i never heard of that before.",
  "true, but that's not all.",
  "it is very spooky!",
  "no he doest have a PRODUCT.",
  "thats both funny and i guess imaginative.",
  "too funny my friend!",
  "the PRODUCT is quite expensive, believe me.",
  "yeah, but who wants to go in?",
  "if you are talking about PERSON - she was his ex.",
  "that's fast!",
  "i could have bought him.",
  "there are?",
  "would you like something to drink?",
  "i'm not sure exactly.",
  "we ate everything from FOOD.",

  "yeah i dont see them as offensive or defensive OCCUPATION.",
  "ya that is too bad.",

  "it does sound familiar.",
  "i wasn't at first!",
  "that sounds absolutely fantastic.",
  "yes they say it is basic",
  "i don't get to go as much as i like.",
  "they can be very smart.",
  "it will be a good PRODUCT for sure.",
  "yes, you should have.",
  "that's not possible for them to think like you",

  "it ’ s fantastic.",
  "i've heard that was good.",
  "on the SPORTS_VENUE.",

  "we really are weak and vulnerable but can move and move and move.",
  "you do know that you can look online, right?",
  "that is what i recently read.",

  "how have they decided to deal with that?",
  "oh wow. didn't know that.",
  "ok, i am sorry for that.",
  "i can't see many of them being musically inclined.",

  "if i were in LOCATION i would probably check it out.",
  "could you drop us off on that LOCATION?",
  "sometimes i follow NORP.",
  "i am glad i am not the only one.",
  "yeah that is pretty funny.",
  "she started feeling suspicious after you said that.",
  "sadly yes.",
  "i would love to be able to but i'm just not creative.",

  "i have never played either.",
  "scarefit!",
  "hmm, that is bad.",
  "i'm gonna see if i can find that concert.",

  "its hard to play.",
  "i think thats great.",
  "i bet they did.",
  "i love that FOOD as well.",
  "i bet he does",
  "that would be a novel WORK_OF_ART!",

  "LOCATION is very far away from everything.",
  "oh he is?!",
  "that i don't know.",
  "i am guilty too.",

  "by some.",
  "that sounds very awesome.",
  "i transferred from another LOCATION.",
  "no.  what can you tell me about it?",
  "you ’ re welcome.",
  "they must be indestructible.",
  "do i have to pay extra?",
  "i do not think he will do it.",
  "it was easier to dial on a rotary PRODUCT.",
  "they could go out and play with their ORG.",
  "she is going to have a full ORG for sure.",
  "yeah i like that one too.",
  "apparently every new WORK_OF_ART since discovers it and loves it.",
  "would you like to go there then?",
  "i know his WORK_OF_ART up but i have not read that.",
  "i wouldn't mind traveling to the LOCATION.",
  "close!",

  "i have always wanted to travel the LOCATION like that.",
  "i wonder if the FAC is still painted.",
  "i came to see my PERSON.",
  "i wonder if that ever happens?",
  "now i see.",
  "i never heard about that either.",
  "that sounds pretty awful.",
  "i haven't seen that one either.",
  "she is a WORK_OF_ART",
  "well, i confess.",
  "i'm not sure but sounds crazy and he should know better.",
  "he wasnt paid to promote them.",
  "oh, i got it.",
  "the BUSINESS isn't helpful.",
  "the most we can offer you at present is 600 PRODUCT.",
  "yes i try to.",
  "it was hilarious.",
  "now tell me about your educational ACADEMIC_DISCIPLINE.",
  "in LOCATION, i think.",
  "i also agree with all his NORP.",
  "it was great.",
  "yeah well he was young when he saw it.",
  "yes, it was wonderful",
  "he was one of those WORK_OF_ART that performed phenomenally once he was officially recruited.",
  "very good.",
  "it ’ s a great PRODUCT.",
  "i do watch them.",
  "isn't that something?",
  "well that's very scary!",
  "it was fun indeed.",
  "i love MUSIC_GENRE.",
  "i'll do that.",
  "i think it would be so cool to go there.",
  "he didn't have to with how popular and rich he's become.",
  "well, i don't know what else you could do then.",
  "i hope they paid him!",
  "i wonder what that was about.",
  "i think that would be horrible!",
  "i don't think that would work out very well.",
  "i'd like to get a ba, but i don't know where i should go.",
  "i would have be happy with only $1m!",
  "however.",
  "i'm going out anyway.",
  "they have to play 40% of it.",
  "by how much?",
  "france?",
  "which season do you like best?",
  "yeah what happened to PERSON was crazy.",
  "that doesn't sound very formal to me!",
  "oh, do you know why?",
  "i knew what you mean.",
  "it's very convenient and it has become popular recently.",
  "i thought he was maybe gay, but i wasn't sure.",
  "i know you can do it.",
  "yes i understand what you are saying.",
  "they are very cool WORK_OF_ART.",
  "wonder why they have them there?",
  "why would someone destroy a beautiful PRODUCT created by a luthier?",
  "sometimes but not very often.",
  "partly, and he's also a hard working OCCUPATION.",
  "well, maybe so.",
  "yes they own about 86% of it but most of it is LOCATION anyways",
  "i wonder who that was.",
  "what do i do here?",
  "i thought you were good at the high TYPE_OF_SPORT!",
  "that's what i thought too!",
  "ya. have you heard of LOCATION?",
  "yeah man!",
  "yes, right.",
  "i do listen to it.",
  "i could see him doing that.",
  "they are definitely the most important in the entire LOCATION for sure!",
  "thats more than i thought.",
  "would you please look at the five LOCATION?",
  "i found this funny.",
  "how's it going on?",
  "yes it is because WORK_OF_ART is colorblind so cannot see green and red",
  "no, they didn't.",
  "that must've been a EVENT.",
  "and what would you like for FOOD?",
  "i had heard something about it.",
  "rather.",
  "i like that too.",
  "those are nice.",
  "yes, i've been wanting it short for a while now.",
  "correct.",
  "nothing unusual, i ’ m afraid.",
  "now what do i do?",
  "they are both really good.",
  "i am allergic to shellfish...maybe that is it.",
  "that was really benefitial i bet!",
  "maybe not them.",
  "the SPORT_TEAM.",
  "i have watched that!",
  "that's what i understand.",
  "i  didn't catch that one.",
  "it must be a terrible WORK_OF_ART then.",
  "around 3pm.",
  "briefly but not as much as the other ORG we have talked about.",
  "id try.",
  "i need to come in right away.",
  "i have seen so much of that recently.",
  "i think you've lost it.",
  "i think someone would be dead by now!",
  "you know i  am not sure.",
  "mr rogers breakdancing?",
  "wow i want to try that actually.",
  "he probably does.",
  "i said i was terribly sorry.",
  "they were smarter than i am.",
  "that's not good.",
  "i wonder what made her change her NORP?",
  "is it overweight?",
  "i think it was the WORK_OF_ART but that's still impressive!",
  "i ’ ll be glad if you would.",
  "i've visited before.",
  "yeah i am glad they kept going though.",
  "i ’ m afraid that i can ’ t do that.",
  "here it is, and here we are.",
  "more or less.",
  "yep that makes me concerned too.",
  "what about tv.",
  "i would listen too.",
  "as in they are too productive or not productive enough?",
  "a little not out of the LOCATION yet though.",
  "i think we just have to look harder and we might find it.",
  "i wonder how much the LAW was.",
  "yeah i guess it was a much more famous TYPE_OF_SPORT back then.",
  "oh no i didn't know that that is very cool.",
  "it ’ s all so interesting.",
  "she is really creative im glad too.",
  "he definitely could at that.",
  "i'm sure it helped.",
  "did anyone approach you to ask you to carry anything for them?",
  "apparently it was because in LANGUAGE.",
  "yeah she totally deserved it and glad that she was awarded and recognized for it",
  "very deliberate indeed but why?",
  "definitely agree with you.",
  "no you would never be able to predict that.",
  "i try to watch when i can.",
  "what are you talking about, we've tried everything!",
  "i never read that one before.",
  "she is the mature, stable, feminine WORK_OF_ART.",
  "no it wouldn't work.",
  "yeah he sure did.",
  "its been good talking to you.",
  "i did not know he did that.",
  "it is good.",
  "that's great one.",
  "who would you say i should start listening to?",
  "we need to upgrade those PRODUCT then.",
  "i would be happy to.",
  "i don't know that i would want to do that.",
  "who is afraid?",
  "wow that would be interesting to watch.",
  "i heard he was willing to sell for only $50 million.",
  "yeah they can weight 1.100 pounds.",
  "that is for sure.",
  "that seems so long ago now.",
  "well, if you need anything, just ask.",

  "i did not .",
  "yes i think it was.",
  "i don't watch BUSINESS tv anymore.",

  "i think they're $ 130.",
  "i wonder how the ORG allowed it twice!",
  "ya that's true.",
  "LANGUAGE, where's that?",
  "yes, i have it right here.",
  "now i do remember the WORK_OF_ART.",
  "yes i have heard that before.",
  "in WORK_OF_ART.",
  "can we bring FOOD by ourselves?",
  "i am not sure exactly.",
  "i thought they were just styling.",
  "it's got to be involuntary.",
  "i don't recall ever watching it.",
  "yes they donated $1 billion for the ORG",
  "no.  i am a OCCUPATION.",
  "i'm sure there is.",
  "oh that is smart of you.",
  "it's an e-PRODUCT.",
  "it does smell good, how much is it?",
  "hmm i have heard of him but do not know much.",

  "that is true indeed.",
  "he might be.",
  "yeah i am totally with you.",
  "that is good of you to say so.",
  "wow for sure they are talented.",

  "i do believe so.",
  "oh, well, the MUSIC_GENRE has stopped.",
  "she is inspiring.",
  "awesome.",
  "wow... is PRODUCT still around ?",
  "i'd strongly recommend that you wait for a while before going swimming.",
  "it must be a really strong PRODUCT for sure.",
  "now, why do you want to exchange it?",
  "it is natural PRODUCT.",
  "that is much appreciated!",
  "i did not notice that.",
  "i don't have an PRODUCT.",
  "ok, ok, got it.",
  "i was surprised to hear that as well.",
  "you were lucky then.",

  "no i didn ’ t.",
  "strange.",
  "i do use that and you are right about advancing.",
  "yeah his EVENT was one of the craziest i have ever been to.",
  "i feel like i have!",
  "i know they are regretting that LAW bi",
  "more than i can count...",
  "i did not know that many!",
  "i feel much better, but i'm still worried about something.",
  "actually, i'd forgotten about it.",
  "oh i never read that one.",
  "ineteresting.",
  "i'm sure she knew you loved her.",
  "i think that is very surprising.",
  "i am not familiar myself.",
  "that's ok.i'm awake now.",
  "i will have to look that up.",
  "i can never forget that.",
  "well, i... anyways, i was just thinking of the red WORK_OF_ART.",
  "what are they doing in LOCATION?",
  "that is just hilarious.",
  "yep you think so.",
  "never went to the SPORTS_VENUE.",
  "via LOCATION.",
  "but we couldn't help it.",
  "i think it was just the first OCCUPATION who was called like that.",
  "oh, yeah, it ’ s terrible.",
  "probably best to stick with the PRODUCT.",
  "yeah i would like to listen to those really.",
  "i suppose they would.",
  "everybody loves raymond!",
  "maybe a BUSINESS i am not sure yet.",
  "yeah i would like to know that myself.",
  "i ’ m so lucky.",
  "i might check it out.",
  "i did see that.",
  "some do.",
  "i know enough to be dangerous.",
  "is it possible for someone to come a little earlier?",
  "i cant recall him playing",
  "someone was able to buy that on PRODUCT?",
  "it was ok in the us but in the uk it failed because they remade it verbatim.",
  "that would sadly not surprise me.",
  "no i didn't know that!",
  "it was nice chatting with you",
  "deny?",
  "oh definitely.",
  "i like FOOD as well.",
  "it must be really bad.",
  "yeah he definitely did.",
  "wow, you're so lucky.",
  "it is useful.",
  "i don ’ t know any of the LAW",
  "it was sad to see him die.",
  "i always wondered that too.",
  "it was a clever WORK_OF_ART.",
  "definitely!",
  "was going to say in the 60's.",
  "maybe i am not sure actually.",
  "i do have an PRODUCT.",
  "that's one of those WORK_OF_ART i looked up when i heard everyone talking about it.",
  "they only started using red and blue to separate the POLITICAL_PARTY in 2000.",
  "i do like attending EVENT.",
  "oh, this's easy.",
  "i have not really.",
  "it is!",
  "i find that so strange and sexist.",
  "yes, but i don't know what FOOD you have.",
  "i hear what you're saying, and i wish there were something i could do.",
  "while i know those are two of those smaller LOCATION.",
  "im not sure..",
  "the sooner the better!",
  "i don't need to remind you that the BUSINESS has become very competitive.",
  "i do the TYPE_OF_SPORT which means anything to keep me from drowning.",
  "those are all good.",
  "it really is a small LOCATION.",
  "i'm not completely sure if it really does.",
  "we must have read the same PRODUCT.",
  "i wonder how often they update the PRODUCT",
  "also in 1972.",
  "isn't that insane how much LOCATION they own?",
  "they are pretty out there.",
  "i agree that he does do that.",
  "oh, as simple as that!",
  "should i take my PRODUCT off?",
  "no. sir, we charge separately.",
  "is he breathing?",
  "that would be extremely difficult to do!",
  "no, we don ’ t.",
  "no.  but.",
  "yea i bet they are filthy rich.",
  "if you don't mind me asking, how much do they cost?",
  "well, if you need anything, just let me know.",
  "but he was trying to beat about the LOCATION.",
  "i am glad to work with you, too.",
  "you probably don't want to now.",
  "i would like to see as many as possible.",
  "yeah i am glad about that.",
  "why would you keep it?",
  "it was great chatting with you too.",
  "i'm glad one has changed.",
  "no, you get those.",
  "how far away is it from the LOCATION?",
  "do you like swimming?",
  "when are you leaving?",
  "i really wonder if they were mad when that happened.",
  "that is pretty cool!",
  "some of it .",
  "ya me too.",
  "i've been pretty busy myself.",
  "i have so many too.",
  "and to get away with that twice means there must have been at least two BUSINESS",
  "that is really surprising!",
  "somehow i doubt it.",
  "i bet she was bullied.",
  "is she just working temporarily?",
  "i think that that is surprisingly practical for the LOCATION.",
  "ya i would love to see that.",
  "no i haven't what's it like.",
  "ah ya i think that is how they started right?",
  "1 % ?",
  "rubin!",
  "i would have gone into the BUSINESS.",
  "BUSINESS has been great for that.",
  "we like a larger PRODUCT.",
  "oh yeah...in 1916.",
  "mr. : i'll drop by later to check on you.",
  "well he is certainly learning to speak better.",
  "that what i heard.",
  "you can feed them on various FOOD.",
  "i'd better see you there.",
  "i ’ m not sure, but i will arrange for you and inform you as well.",
  "it will be here soon!",
  "i will check it out..",
  "that's cool..",
  "and i bet he never imagined just how big BUSINESS would get.",
  "have you decided whether or not you would like to go?",
  "i feel like it would help.",
  "yes i wonder that too.",
  "sorry, we can ’ t come down any more.",
  "i'm just a little tired.",
  "i am assuming that some of them will.",
  "lived in dc for a while.",
  "that seems reasonable.",
  "thats what i would think also.",
  "i honestly do not know.",
  "i did not know there was one",
  "i would love to see that.",
  "you should use the a4 PRODUCT is all right.",
  "actually, i've only got a two-PRODUCT.",
  "i'm sure they are.",
  "i never heard that before.",
  "i ’ ll take it.",
  "is that so?",
  "fascinating!",
  "yep he's awesome!",
  "i didn't know either.",
  "are you going fishing?",
  "yes, but i don't really use it often.",
  "why don't you just go home and eat?",
  "can you just tell me?",
  "speaking of LOCATION.",
  "yeah its pretty useful though.",
  "that is amazing how he did that",
  "thats too expensive.",
  "i actually enjoy some of it!",
  "nobody has those anymore...",
  "yep it doesn't seem fair.",
  "ok.it's 22 PRODUCT",
  "how long are you going to stay in LOCATION?",
  "it is neat.",
  "that seems very extreme!",
  "don ’ t you think it needs about a little taken off and talk to.",
  "you should very qualified.",
  "no.but there are quite many PRODUCT.",
  "i'm shocked that the BUSINESS was discontinued as long ago as 2003.",
  "he was good enough to do it once.",
  "i think he plays TYPE_OF_SPORT though.",
  "now i play PRODUCT.",
  "i did not...",
  "there actually was one in the WORK_OF_ART.",
  "i think has to be more strict .",
  "on a global WORK_OF_ART.",
  "that might be the same one.",
  "thank you again.",
  "reagan?",
  "i didnt realize that.",
  "i bet the would be interesting to watch!",
  "i wonder if that is only if you are using PRODUCT to go somewhere.",
  "i'm not sure, but i think so.",
  "it ’ s becoming more and more common.",
  "apparently it is.",
  "it's really crazy!",
  "good for him.",
  "never had a pet ANIMAL though.",
  "yes i guess they are still safer and protected from hacking.",
  "i might take that over forcing us to listen to us MUSIC_GENRE.",
  "ten kg!",
  "i that you have it.",
  "ha i would love to do that.",
  "LOCATION...",
  "you'll check it out anyway you want.",
  "i liked both.",
  "no, exactly not.",
  "you should check online.",
  "no, i ’ m afraid not.",
  "i would have to look that up.",
  "yes, i'm afraid there is.",
  "well compared to POLITICAL_PARTY it was way less.",
  "supply and demand!",
  "not much i can do.",
  "yeah she was really cool.",
  "the FAC closed.",
  "ok i'll have to check it out.",
  "you should make a FOOD like that.",
  "so far, so good.",
  "i just eat some oatmeal, FOOD, and orange juice.",
  "i believe most of them think of it as good public WORK_OF_ART.",
  "would be cool if we could..",
  "grangerfield!",
  "it has become big.",
  "he could just sue them.",
  "it's hard to describe.",
  "but now they are 104 billion",
  "you don't even want to get me started on 45.",
  "i watched those here and there",
  "i'm gonna introduce myself.",
  "other than getting my PRODUCT fitted.",
  "it's going to be $ 55.",
  "sports are fun!",
  "did it?",
  "no i did not.",
  "that is very awesome.",
  "they they seem really popular.",
  "what are you trying to say?",
  "usa!",
  "i'm sorry - i still don't understand.",
  "no, i didn't know i could do that.",
  "very true indeed.",
  "what made you decide to join our ORG?",
  "i'm working on it.",
  "only two of them.",
  "no.  that is crazy.",
  "im not sure that would have worked with this last EVENT.",
  "no  apparerntly were banned when they forst came out.",
  "speaking of BUSINESS.",
  "i've actually never seen it.",
  "it's funny i don't really listen to the PRODUCT at all anymore.",
  "i wouldn't be surprised if they've already tried.",
  "that PRODUCT is for coaching ?",
  "she did have a great OCCUPATION.",
  "that would be hilarious!",
  "he's growing like he's getting paid for it!",
  "and that prevented him from being able to go to LOCATION.",
  "what's to come next?",
  "oh i do not know that.",
  "why were you in LOCATION?",
  "it must have been really bad.",
  "mm, yes, but i think i like that one better.",
  "well... what are you interested in?",
  "i have heard of her.",
  "that is very funny.",
  "there must be something wrong with her.",
  "it's moving so slow.",
  "she must be very popular!",
  "yeah makes me kind of hungry.",
  "didn't i ask you to clean it up earlier?",
  "i did hear something about that.",
  "i guess he was ....slow?",
  "that's true and it's free!",
  "gosh!",
  "yes i've always wanted to go to LOCATION",
  "all right, let me get your FOOD for you.",
  "yeah and BUSINESS bought them for a whooping 1.65 billion.",
  "yeah i hope we can go past that almost 63%.",
  "that is really amazing.",
  "you're right, i'll change it.",
  "you can pick and choose?",
  "yeah you'd think they are playing to win and everything else is secondary.",
  "it sounds so complicated!",
  "about 12.",
  "terrific!",
  "jeez.",
  "i know how that goes.",
  "nfc!",
  "i'm sure.",
  "i think i'll pass on that too.",
  "that's just perfect for me.",
  "i do not have a favorite one.",
  "what could be worse than what you just told me?",
  "i remember that and it is strange now.",
  "that is very impressive of them to do that!",
  "yes they should have invested in BUSINESS.",
  "$75 million.",
  "i wonder why that was.",
  "he's super tall!",
  "i agree it does seem to be getting worse.",
  "right how did they get broke so fast",
  "well, everything we've discussed seems to be here.",
  "my PRODUCT is kind of oily.",
  "EVENT is friday.",
  "i bet.",
  "nice i still have not seen those",
  "no, i insist.",
  "ACADEMIC_DISCIPLINE?",
  "i dont know but definately is odd.",
  "he thinks he is so cool and he's really.",
  "it's pretty amazing how far PRODUCT has come since being started in 2004",
  "ya i buy PRODUCT from them.",
  "yes i guess that might explain it.",
  "they should now you made me wonder how much they spend on bandwidth.",
  "through the tv.",
  "that i actually knew :)",
  "seems like i have heard that before.",
  "WORK_OF_ART is stoic though.",
  "i don't really recall it either.",
  "and is she helping him?",
  "what if. start from PRODUCT.",
  "yeah i did not know either.",
  "that's strange!",
  "oh, i will.",
  "thats interesting!",
  "i wonder how much of the PRODUCT she actually digests",
  "sounds good, and so, why do you want to work with them?",
  "since there are four of you, would you like to split a second FOOD?",
  "how kind of them.",
  "well, that's probably true, but i don't think we should be dogmatic about it.",
  "i had heard that!",
  "that is also true.",
  "i think it should be more useful to hand out some PRODUCT which is also cheaper.",
  "i wouldn't do that alone either.",
  "that's pretty awesome of them.",
  "i bet it does too!",
  "i've never seen those.",
  "i'm an old ORG.",
  "that is so hilarious.",
  "no i dont agree either.",
  "yes thats really good of him.",
  "never heard about it.",
  "i am.",
  "sorry, i don't have it.",
  "i dont know what shows she is on.",
  "i agree that is funny; it was probably hard not to laugh judging from the WORK_OF_ART!",
  "that is something pretty amazing.",
  "please allow me to introduce myself.",
  "that's 35 PRODUCT each.",
  "straight outta compton!",
  "i've heard they do.",
  "i think it is too.",
  "ha. could be.",
  "im guessing not long.",
  "some.",
  "i'm sorry, but i have to go.",
  "that is clever.",
  "yep i wonder that too.",
  "they might be.",
  "i think he is the only one.",
  "i'm terribly sorry.",
  "i got to be honest the older i get and as far as what they stand for i'm leaning more and more NORP.",
  "okay, finally i understand.",
  "i know that they were very popular before tv.",
  "yeah and i wonder what they do with all that LOCATION",
  "do you like the BUSINESS?",
  "oh sorry.",
  "that was also ridiculous.",
  "it was purchased on the EVENT of november at 3",
  "i liked him actually.",
  "i don't really.",
  "i guess i sort of get it?",
  "that is sexist and needs to go.",
  "i think they're ok.",
  "they only displayed 54 PRODUCT",
  "i would love to hear it.",
  "then what do you think about it?",
  "sounds like an evil WORK_OF_ART!",
  "talk later!",
  "i really dont think there is anything they can't do.",
  "have you ever heard of ACADEMIC_DISCIPLINE?",
  "they certainly would have.",
  "yeah i'm not sure",
  "yeah PRODUCT is #1.",
  "it's always cool to learn new ACADEMIC_DISCIPLINE.",
  "true they were so bad there were even LAW",
  "yes it is calming though.",
  "maybe he has too.",
  "yes he was drafted in 2000 and was born in 1977 so he is so old to still be winning!",
  "great, then let's go visit him.",
  "no. who is it?",
  "oh, i see it now.",
  "yep it is housed at the FAC.",
  "i hope they are able to pull it off.",
  "thats very considerate of them.",
  "was there anyone else with you?",
  "what happened to him then?",
  "i heard he won the CHAMPIONSHIP in 1958.",
  "well, thank you, but it's not all that hard to do, you know.",
  "good, i can still attend the SPORTS_EVENT.",
  "that is nice of them.",
  "i was reading about how the ORG is trying to process so many.",
  "so, even if someone wasn't directly involved, they can become involved?",
  "it was funny indeed.",
  "and then hope that the PRODUCT wasn't incredibly expensive.",
  "just open your PRODUCT so we can check them.",
  "i got it 2nd PRODUCT too.",
  "the monthly PRODUCT costs you.",
  "they are and very pretty.",
  "you must've been speeding.",
  "can you imagine commuting on a ANIMAL.",
  "i dont really know what SPORT_TEAM he plays for.",
  "what happened to her?",
  "well, then, i'll talk to you later.",
  "you may be right about that.",
  "i think you can only watch it on PRODUCT.",
  "it's r, o, s, e, d, a, l, e.",
  "is there anything that i need to bring with me?",
  "he is impressive.",
  "exactly right.",
  "i didn't realize that!",
  "oh that is what it is called.",
  "they also.",
  "it's not too late.",
  "that's actually super interesting.",
  "quite!",
  "you seem to have it down.",
  "i'm only too happy to help.",
  "yes, we should.",
  "oh, i'm very sorry about that.",
  "well!",
  "that's anticlimactic PRODUCT.",
  "i dont' think the us would handle it well if he did that.",
  "yeah, i did.",
  "it doesn't matter much.",
  "too look for that now.",
  "it totally does.",
  "it would have to be.",
  "well, i can ’ t just image it.",
  "should each of us write separately?",
  "rip billy mays!",
  "yeah they stopped making them back in 2003.",
  "i am assuming that the PRODUCT is casual.",
  "yeah he does.",
  "it probably goes back a while.",
  "oh, sure, it was great.",
  "it really is widespread!",
  "sounds ideal.",
  "i've never seen them.",
  "i think that must be a legal LAW.",
  "not with all the FOOD i eat.",
  "i don't think there are enough ORG that play currently to have them separate.",
  "well, i ’ ve been working so hard lately, so i ’ ll probably just take it easy.",
  "i really want to listen to that.",
  "ha i would so do that.",
  "that's not true.",
  "hmmm....i'm not sure.",
  "mind blown!",
  "i didnt know they did.",
  "you have to wonder how it got up there.",
  "i'm sure it's fairly common.",
  "well, do what you like to do.",
  "don't always joke like that!",
  "it is cancelled.",
  "they were?",
  "let me see what's available.",
  "no i didn't hear about him.",
  "yeah thats kinda weird.",
  "i wondered about that.",
  "FOOD is my favorite.",
  "ok, that's all.",
  "i vaguely recall that.",
  "i do actually!",
  "that is almost unbelievable.",
  "ll",
  "the LOCATION are good.",
  "so are they feral then?",
  "222 to 0.",
  "i used to watch it too.",
  "someone you're living with.",
  "any more?",
  "ok, see you soon.",
  "i might just do that.",
  "impossible!",
  "i'm glad you're so happy.",
  "that is a very strange NORP for them to have.",
  "we will fine you if you damage it.",
  "when did you start worrying about your PRODUCT?",
  "well that is my thought's as well.",
  "do you want to type that WORK_OF_ART?",
  "he's not top 3 is he?",
  "i'm pretty sure she.",
  "they should have put that in.",
  "i like WORK_OF_ART too.",
  "no i did not heard of it.",
  "he was pretty big later on.",
  "he is NORP.",
  "the PRODUCT through was invented in 1975!",
  "it should be banned for being boring.",
  "yes, i guess i should try to use it.",
  "which one?",
  "oh that's very true!",
  "if she got her own PRODUCT.",
  "i'm afraid i'll be late.",
  "i think i did hear that somewhere.",
  "i really wanted you to come, but i understand.",
  "that's ok.is breakfast included?",
  "no. mine are still small.",
  "it sure is/",
  "well the current FAC does.",
  "nope not really.",
  "first EVENT since 1846!",
  "i do not know PERSON.",
  "ANIMAL are good with blue and yellow but not green and red.",
  "sure, we do.",
  "i think he is around here.",
  "probably to make it more comfortable when they play.",
  "i think they might have originated in LOCATION.",
  "maybe i could help you with what you need to get done.",
  "i don't know how long it is or how you apply or how they figure out when you're not using your PRODUCT but it is pretty neat of them.",
  "and you should be!",
  "yeah i actually liked him when he first came out",
  "i heard once that PERSON.",
  "i bet your PRODUCT went everywhere...",
  "i never had the PRODUCT.",
  "i guess it just wasn't the same!",
  "i am afraid no.",
  "good that he resembled his old, quick WORK_OF_ART.",
  "no, because i didn't know what i wanted to do.",
  "yes, here it is.",
  "not too sure how tall she is.",
  "the PRODUCT is fascinating.",
  "it's not the right PRODUCT.",
  "hopefully i wouldn't get suspended like they did.",
  "how about a little FOOD then?",
  "that sounds really fun actually.",
  "ive heard of him.",
  "i shall not keep you long then.",
  "well they won recently didn't they?",
  "and BUSINESS.",
  "could be fake.",
  "he can be quite funny.",
  "im BUSINESS.",
  "i really envy you.",
  "happy women's day.",
  "precisely.",
  "but if the FOOD is good and well prepared, it will do much good.",
  "it is pretty amazing and how much you can watch on tv.",
  "what do you want for your FOOD?",
  "yes, you should be there.",
  "or bruce lee dance!",
  "yeah isn't that just crazy how many there are?",
  "i dont want the other BUSINESS to disappear.",
  "i just said that!",
  "i did when i was young.",
  "go right ahead.",
  "yeah, so are you planning on going?",
  "i was there as it happened.",
  "no, a no. 50 will take you right there.",
  "yeah i would have to agree!",
  "how do we know this?",
  "it wasn't.",
  "yeah as it usually happens.",
  "she's very friendly.",
  "so crazy!",
  "god save me!",
  "i do remember that PRODUCT as well.",
  "i don't know.",
  "wish him to be healthy soon.",
  "yeah usually they do it on the fourth of july in LOCATION if im correct.",
  "were you wearing your PRODUCT when you noticed them, sir?",
  "i think he deserves a higher OCCUPATION.",
  "that'd be great.",
  "yes it s more comfortable for them to play",
  "i am pretty easily entertained.",
  "the would have been wild.",
  "that's so sad.",
  "er, let me see.",
  "nice i did not know that.",
  "i won ’ t beat around the bush.",
  "guess i agree with you.",
  "alright, we are waiting for you at 7.",
  "lets talk about the LOCATION next.",
  "no, he doesn ’",
  "and the us ORG is subsidizing it.",
  "i guess you just do what you are accustomed to.",
  "i did like it.",
  "that and some carries!",
  "he must take that very seriously.",
  "what happened next?",
  "i'm guilty..",
  "ye, i hope so.well.",
  "nyc?",
  "that's correct!",
  "yes, i am sure.",
  "oh, i am sorry to hear that.",
  "well, i am telling you now.",
  "thank you, bye.",
  "next left then right?",
  "i am sure eventually something else will come.",
  "i feel like LOCATION is where to go.",
  "ya that is appalling.",
  "i don't know who he is either.",
  "i'm not going to be able to do that.",
  "i mean.",
  "i guess some of the ORG were just as influential and wealthy.",
  "that would be interesting to hear.",
  "not as much as i'd like to.",
  "i haven't thought it over at all.",
  "he was!",
  "i don ’ t know much about him.",
  "ah..",
  "you ’ re the best!",
  "i bet they don't.",
  "you can send a compressed one.",
  "yes this is the best we can do.",
  "that is pretty interesting as well.",
  "i'm not even sure that would do it for me.",
  "he's multi talented.",
  "do you like the BUSINESS then?",
  "that's pretty bad.",
  "that must have been embarrassing.",
  "ya that is very silly.",
  "it's my new PRODUCT earphone.",
  "okay, do we need any FOOD?",
  "yeah because he believe only then can give him what he needed",
  "oh, let's see what's wrong.",
  "i'm afraid we can't agree to that.",
  "oh!",
  "i think there is one now.",
  "i thought i heard that.",
  "very well said.",
  "or 111?",
  "well put.",
  "he certainly was talented.",
  "yeah it is pretty cool.",
  "related to POLITICAL_PARTY.",
  "never even thought of that!",
  "i though it was extremely sad.",
  "that's either amazing or just plain sad.",
  "that does sound good.",
  "no but i hear if two of them get stuck together.",
  "what is a silent album?",
  "yeah the t PRODUCT.",
  "thats mean.",
  "yes, but i still don't have many ORG here yet.",
  "no... it does not benefit them to do so.",
  "i think that is hilarious that they did!",
  "because i've already proved it.",
  "i have never listened to his MUSIC_GENRE.",
  "ok, we'll wait a while.",
  "WORK_OF_ART are not funny at all.",
  "i don't remember how many he has done.",
  "yeah but i do wonder if they presidents live in those FAC or not",
  "i'm honestly not sure about that one.",
  "i ’ m afraid not.",
  "there's only one left handed qb in the SPORTS_LEAGUE.",
  "if someone recycles their plastic PRODUCT at them.",
  "i do not have a particularly specific one.",
  "i suspect you're right.",
  "i know those were hugely popular before tv.",
  "interpersonal and technical ACADEMIC_DISCIPLINE.",
  "i totally understand.",
  "maybe some other LOCATION had it.",
  "WORK_OF_ART was awesome!",
  "i ’ ll hire you anyway.",
  "that is true until 2016.",
  "yeah i think that's good.",
  "who is?",
  "that is insane indeed.",
  "i used to watch it back when i was little.",
  "right here, please.",
  "i realize it was rough for the ORG and i they are still touring.",
  "there are over 300 registered WORK_OF_ART in the us!",
  "qb is the most important OCCUPATION.",
  "now that is hilarious.",
  "i may just do that.",
  "but they're so good.",
  "we can work something out.",
  "oh wow i shoudl check it out.",
  "they have over 137 million total BUSINESS worldwide.",
  "i think he'll keep going until he can't.",
  "you've got it.",
  "they roasted them terribly.",
  "are you stupid?",
  "nope not at all.",

  "that ’ s all i needed to know.",
  "thats really nice of him.",
  "some!",
  "that's nice.",
  "pretty good, thank you.",
  "that is hard too imagine i agree.",

  "sounds like it was a close PRODUCT.",
  "i think it is really cool.",
  "i will check them out.",
  "i'm so tired of them.",
  "that is something i never considered.",
  "i dont about that but something funny happened to the BUSINESS.",
  "that is crazy but BUSINESS has to be careful.",
  "i'm sure he is.",
  "do you mind if i go with you?",
  "full-PRODUCT, please.",
  "no. not at all.",
  "i don't think that is too bad.",
  "is there anything else you'd like to get?",
  "i ’ ve got to think it over some more.",
  "you mean they're kicking you out?",
  "i think maybe consistently used since 2000.",
  "what about TYPE_OF_SPORT?",
  "oh me too!",
  "i didn't know that and",
  "i did before PRODUCT.",
  "i don't know much about him.",
  "he got arrested all right.",
  "i would definitely need that.",
  "that would be weird nowadays.",
  "yes it is because WORK_OF_ART is colorblind and cannot see green and red",
  "you're welcome, bye!",
  "he seems to be a good OCCUPATION though.",
  "fine, then you can say, “ so there you are!",
  "that.",
  "you mean that you can them.",
  "they are fragile PRODUCT.",
  "i hope he was too.",
  "i think that had more to do with PERSON.",
  "have you even thought that far ahead?",
  "so, then why did you speed up?",
  "i had not until recently.",
  "oh, why didn't you say so then?",
  "PERSON i think was good too.",
  "i like them both maybe gymnastics a little more.",
  "i did not knew that.",
  "i wish i was aware of them back then as well.",
  "how much is that going to cost me?",
  "well, that's for all.",
  "how is that working out for you?",
  "so glad they got rid of those.",
  "i would think there would be more.",
  "thank you you too.",
  "its a PRODUCT.",
  "all that's left is to cook it.",
  "so sorry i'm not sure about this.",
  "well there you go.",
  "it's when you look yourself up online.",
  "six are compulsory, two optional.",
  "i want to do that.",
  "true enough!",
  "yes that was pretty recent actually.",
  "she was smart and kind to teach him.",
  "i think his WORK_OF_ART aren't very good.",
  "i can come down and fix that for you if you'd like.",
  "that would be an awesome PRODUCT!",
  "if you use a pink PRODUCT.",
  "verlander!",
  "never heard of that.",
  "i have heard that too.",
  "oh yeah they are constantly tracking what PRODUCT you even look at while browsing around.",
  "i just read it and its very surprising.",
  "...or a LOCATION!",
  "this has been so interesting.",
  "oh that's crazy.",
  "yeah that is quite something.",
  "very bold but glad it worked out for him!",
  "555-7658",
  "that's away awesome.",
  "i am going to start calling them that.",
  "oh, i thought there were going to be eight.",
  "that is a great one.",
  "ha i wonder what he would sing about.",
  "that ’ s what i understand.",
  "maybe a little!",
  "it's very interesting.",
  "yea!",
  "that is ridiculous!",
  "that would also be nice.",
  "but it works!",
  "that PRODUCT looks lovely on you, but it ’ s not very practical, is it?",
  "nope i never knew that which WORK_OF_ART was it",
  "i never dreamed of doing this either.",
  "okay, i ’ ll take four, please.",
  "no, this is my first EVENT here.",
  "i guess if you're from LOCATION.",
  "what is your greatest WORK_OF_ART?",
  "wow i also hear when he was sworn in that he did not use the PRODUCT.",
  "maybe they just think i'm not posting anything ;)",
  "i'm not sure it's true.",
  "i can ’ t afford that.",
  "i do like it.",
  "yes, but... well...",
  "maybe edgar  allen should have learned something.",
  "i would like it blended.",
  "here, take one of these PRODUCT.",
  "is that with jack n?",
  "why don't you like PRODUCT?",
  "can i use the PRODUCT?",
  "i did not see it.",
  "yes they definitely nail it.",
  "i'll say yes.",
  "i'll have to look that one up!",
  "i know and she feels uncomfortable about it..",
  "wow. good for him.",
  "thank you, goodbye.",
  "i think that we are higher and it will continue to fluctuate for a while.",
  "moar trump!",
  "i am sorry for making you wait so long.",
  "i think that is amazing that they do that but i do not understand how that works to be honest",
  "i'm not sure what they thought they were filming.",
  "i think i'm quite fit for a OCCUPATION.",
  "do you know what PRODUCT he wears?",
  "oh my god!",
  "you don't have to do that...",
  "i understand he is not the only one to come to the us.",
  "i believe it was the PRODUCT. from 1908",
  "so you do not feel he is qualified to coach the SPORT_TEAM?",
  "can i get you anything else?",
  "hopefully it has ORG on it too!",
  "i try not to let them watch too much tv",
  "i have not although i should try that out.",
  "i wouldn't like to see that either.",
  "how about the FOOD?",
  "it probably was too costly.",
  "that's very generous.",
  "i vaguely do.",
  "i did collect them!",
  "this is amazing.",
  "i dont understand LOCATION.",
  "normally, they're $ 2 each.",
  "maybe not LOCATION though.",
  "i bet you would if you were on mt. everest though.",
  "who knows maybe he will.",
  "they were much simpler back then.",
  "given his OCCUPATION.",
  "who bought it from them?",
  "i can believe that. sadly!",
  "i ’ m just going to keep going to BUSINESS.",
  "yeah but i am glad they turned it down because they couldn't even keep themselves from going under.",
  "no it's not!",
  "you're going to re-sell it on BUSINESS?",
  "it would be interesting to watch sometime.",
  "well, it's snowing.",
  "i'll try that.",
  "that he did.",
  "i should try to watch it.",
  "i ride a PRODUCT.",
  "ya the LOCATION.",
  "it must be strange for you to live in LOCATION.",
  "i hope i don ’ t ever see you back in here.",
  "well, i doubt that.",
  "i hope i never get struck by one!",
  "do you like any MUSIC_GENRE of his in particular?",
  "yeah i agree completely with that.",
  "i would always be ready to go shopping with you!",
  "oh, where is that?",
  "i was really scared when he pulled the PRODUCT out.",
  "we could even teach them how to use the PRODUCT.",
  "you dance beautifully too.",
  "but it is really worthwhile.",
  "did they ever catch the WORK_OF_ART of that?",
  "that SPORTS_VENUE must be awesome.",
  "i know one was PERSON.",
  "i am no sure.",
  "that is kind of strange to me.",
  "i am wiped out.",
  "how do we get started?",
  "just press into it gently with your PRODUCT.",
  "yeah i think that might be true.",
  "i'm sure they appreciated them like crazy for doing that.",
  "i'm too fat for a PRODUCT.",
  "it's a WORK_OF_ART!",
  "he is handsome and athletic also intelligent helping him along",
  "i don't remember it either.",
  "yeah that is pretty expensive but their LOCATION are really good so there you go",
  "who knows maybe they do.",
  "he's good but not great.",
  "yeah and speaking of learning something new.",
  "i'm not sure but i would be curious to know.",
  "you mean fictionally right?",
  "ok.if you really insist, i could always use the BUSINESS.",
  "oh wow... did not know that!",
  "before he made the top three, i was so nervous.",
  "what are your favourite WORK_OF_ART?",
  "i didnt know there was a new PRODUCT.",
  "not much ; it was a minor LAW back then.",
  "id believe it.",
  "what are you looking for now?",
  "it wont get done anytime soon.",
  "i wonder what is behind that.",
  "but i think they're dull, aren't they?",
  "sounds like the really like PRODUCT",
  "i'm sure they wouldn't appreciate that.",
  "i concur.",
  "wow, that sounds great.",
  "i understand and i too think it is realistic.",
  "i believe that is correct.",
  "i wonder what he endorses.",
  "if i were you, i wouldn't drink too much.",
  "oh, can you hear me ok?",
  "i guess so .",
  "i guess it would keep me awake as well.",
  "i agree with that as well!",
  "not too sure on that.",
  "that could be fun.",
  "they are smart.",
  "it ’ s very interesting actually.",
  "well, all tight.",
  "no i do not?",
  "i don ’ t know what to tell you.",
  "yes, we ’ ll do so.",
  "but i'm not sure you're strong enough yet.",
  "yeah, are they easy to look after?",
  "i think only the ORG will be there.",
  "i absolutely hate driving so i'm totally interested.",
  "on PRODUCT.",
  "wow they are so powerful.",
  "i think so too.",
  "yeah, it sounds easy.",
  "yeah i'm going to check it out too.",
  "if i recall .",
  "well, it's not as crowded as we expected, is it?",
  "i think he would have make a good WORK_OF_ART.",
  "it seems that it's all about me.",
  "does that include FOOD?",
  "it's $ 180.",
  "which ones?",
  "no, they live alone.",
  "i will have to look that up!",
  "yes they are very outspoken.",
  "it has been!",
  "many fo them actually.",
  "oh, how interesting.",
  "i know he really deserves this.",
  "what's in a dahl?",
  "well me personally.",
  "i feel there must be something.",
  "thats so weird how does that even happen",
  "i would love to hear what that sounds like.",
  "let me see your id.",
  "that won't happen again, i'm sorry.",
  "and in more than 200 LOCATION",
  "it's been great talking to you.",
  "yeah i heard that.",
  "ok then, i ’ ll follow you.",
  "now with PRODUCT.",
  "yean.",
  "i still don't understand how PRODUCT works.",
  "what FOOD are we out of?",
  "i didn't know that happened.",
  "physically yes.",
  "i feel well now.",
  "ok, you're the OCCUPATION.",
  "that is astounding.",
  "yes it seems so.",
  "yep i agree that seems really dumb.",
  "BUSINESS.",
  "do you need someone to drive you home?",
  "i live where it's warm",
  "try the PRODUCT as well.",
  "just one PRODUCT-on and one that i want to check.",
  "that would be nice, thank you.",
  "and i don't like FOOD that much.",
  "my ORG.",
  "charles dickens?",
  "yes i'm not sure.",
  "well maybe that's right",
  "he's okay.",
  "i'm going to check it out now.",
  "i wonder about that too .",
  "that's interesting to imagine!",
  "they don't mind.",
  "it costs $ 200.",
  "ya that is sad.",
  "i like them all.",
  "actually true now that i think about it.",
  "out in the LOCATION.",
  "if that is what he is thinking then great.",
  "we should.",
  "i dont have an PRODUCT.",
  "hmm it was 1997 when they moved into SPORTS_VENUE.",
  "who doesn't?",
  "i guess she thought she was pretty cool.",
  "some think so.",
  "the comedian?",
  "even when he's not winning he plays well.",
  "are you interested in ANIMAL?",
  "it was for BUSINESS.",
  "we'd like to.",
  "pleased to meet you.",
  "how much are you depositing?",
  "sure, you can.",
  "it is but it's also sad because they haven't won since then.",
  "let ’ s think.",
  "i loved playing PRODUCT when i was younger.",
  "i always liked WORK_OF_ART better anyway.",
  "i think it probably didn't translate to a different NORP.",
  "i was just cleaning out my safe and found a PRODUCT of old 45's.",
  "i am surprised about that too!",
  "that is odd..",
  "oh, do you enjoy it?",
  "i wonder what he did think.",
  "i believe it was because it was the easiest to dial on a rotary PRODUCT.",
  "i have never been to NATION.",
  "speaking of visual.",
  "and why are you returning them?",
  "i don't see how that's possible.",
  "i attended LOCATION.",
  "i would have never of guessed that.",
  "i have read a few on them but on the PRODUCT.",
  "i know you didn't.",
  "i did hear that before.",
  "that is amusing.",
  "i've already got it.",
  "oh i understand you.",
  "i read PERSON is really good in it",
  "do you BUSINESS marvel comics?",
  "you can ’ t think of anything?",
  "that is just ridiculous.",
  "it's very scary to think about.",
  "yeah pretty cool - i don't understand how you get a PRODUCT out of that",
  "i did actually but it was kind of boring.",
  "i would say that would be lowest one!",
  "i have never seen one of those.",
  "it was fairly weak.",
  "well he's famous.",
  "you have to pay to use the PRODUCT.",
  "ya i wish i had a ANIMAL.",
  "more.",
  "yeah i bet they would like that back.",
  "it was actually awesome.",
  "not as far as i know.",
  "no, we didn ’ t.",
  "you mean you can't flex your PRODUCT?",
  "can you imagine if that LAW still applied.",
  "i believe i have heard of him.",
  "they don't really split it.",
  "i bet that he is pretty good.",
  "they most likely did at that.",
  "where is that?",
  "i guess i should look into this.",
  "he was a NORP",
  "i should have known.",
  "some do, some don't.",
  "it was for 10",
  "i think that's because of the SPORT_TEAM.",
  "that's really cool of him to do that.",
  "i have played TYPE_OF_SPORT.",
  "probably not too many.",
  "no i actually do not.",
  "when did you begin to drink?",
  "i didn't see that.",
  "do you think anything interesting is frozen beneath that LOCATION?",
  "yes .remember.",
  "yep i heard about that!",
  "i ’ ll have to weigh it first.",
  "well, we could just go out as ORG.",
  "can i have a FOOD?",
  "that's pretty amazing they never get cut.",
  "no i actually didn't know that",
  "i bet it's pretty cool.",
  "yes, i did, but i didn ’ t do very well.",
  "do you want to know where i got mine from?",
  "i think they might feel it as well.",
  "i wonder how tall that FAC is really.",
  "i can get that for you.",
  "it does, but it won't connect to anything.",
  "it's been good talking with you.",
  "i really do not think so.",
  "is he pretty ethnic?",
  "he was just amazing overall.",
  "why can ’ t you give it back to me?",
  "we hope that you are feeling better soon.",
  "he wasnt a OCCUPATION though.",
  "ohhhhh i did not know that.",
  "i see him.",
  "that's terrible to hear.",
  "not sure maybe she didnt think it was",
  "i've heard that and i can't believe it.",
  "they are the PRODUCT.",
  "professor wood?",
  "no.  please tell me about it.",
  "there must be several private BUSINESS that are interested in employing someone like you.",
  "that's pretty hard to believe anyone could read that fast.",
  "i think he's hot too.",
  "WORK_OF_ART is my fav ever!",
  "FOOD...",
  "do you want to borrow my PRODUCT?",
  "it really does and they are simple to make.",
  "i don't even know how that's possible.",
  "is there an BUSINESS near me?",
  "i think it looks gorgeous.",
  "all right, then let's begin.",
  "how about you PRODUCT style?",
  "i'm 6'4\".",
  "who.",
  "it's certainly a popular TYPE_OF_SPORT.",
  "700k.",
  "i know that is what i was talking about!",
  "well it has been a good EVENT chat with you.",
  "wow that doesn't make me feel like our OCCUPATION are all that safe.",
  "i'm sure it would be hard to do so but maybe!",
  "that sounds impossible!",
  "yeah i think that is so cool.",
  "i thought that is who you meant.",
  "yeah that can be annoying.",
  "that's fine with me.",
  "that will work out.",
  "until then.",
  "i am not sure what happened but they surely have not won since then",
  "it all sounds bizarre to me!",
  "come on, it's easy, and it'll make you feel good.",
  "he/she would really?",
  "probably but they are not going to stop being loyal to the SPORT_TEAM.",
  "that is bizarre for sure.",
  "they have become quite clever.",
  "anything that can keep my PRODUCT clean will do.",
  "very true and astute again!",
  "i agree i wouldn't too.",
  "yes, some.",
  "yeah and all other motorized PRODUCT.",
  "well i am not sure",
  "i'm still nervous.",
  "i knew it was used mostly in LOCATION.",
  "i cannot play.",
  "that is funny..",
  "yeah and even stranger he was not even mentioned in it",
  "didn't tell me what?",
  "it doesn't work.",
  "no, he walks.",
  "and how do i withdraw if i need to?",
  "i like MUSIC_GENRE mostly.",
  "that's curious.",
  "ok.let's do it together.",
  "how can there be so many of them?",
  "a b movie?",
  "why don't you go to see the FAC?",
  "yeah right it can get pretty crazy.",
  "quite true.",
  "yep i want to try it on!",
  "that is so hard.",
  "that seems like something that shouldn't happen.",
  "yes i believe you're correct.",
  "yeah i want to catch that one too on the PRODUCT.",
  "he would not have lost 222-0",
  "i don't believe it.",
  "and that's wild if you think about it!",
  "i remember that WORK_OF_ART from bb.",
  "yes it is strange how they are named.",
  "she's 42.",
  "i like WORK_OF_ART!",
  "it's fascinating to me.",
  "i no longer use PRODUCT.",
  "i used to live in that LOCATION.",
  "i wonder how they measure that ?",
  "i think something in the LOCATION would be nice.",
  "yes it has been nice talking to you",
  "the LOCATION is getting pretty much chewed up.",
  "a mere $50 million?!",
  "i think you are right there.",
  "yeah but very costly",
  "he did!",
  "are you telling me he cannot do that move naturally??",
  "yeah that is actually quite funny.",
  "is there anything i should do?",
  "i'm sure they are trying to help as much as they can.",
  "i blame him for getting caught.",
  "youd have to be flexible to play TYPE_OF_SPORT.",
  "that stinks.",
  "i've always wanted to visit LOCATION!",
  "i like LOCATION.",
  "i guess i do.",
  "oh. sorry to hear that.",
  "yes, we can do that.",
  "i am going to LOCATION soon.",
  "sounds marvelous.",
  "i havent seen that one maybe i will check if its on BUSINESS.",
  "uh-oh, here we go...",
  "that is something.",
  "i think that is a good idea.however.",
  "do you want to know where i bought mine?",
  "i'm not sure honestly.",
  "TYPE_OF_SPORT is probably the most popular.",
  "i havent seen either.",
  "that is interesting i wonder what they like to eat",
  "that's impossible.",
  "very good!",
  "i wonder which states they were blocked in?",
  "that seems scary also.",
  "some modern PRODUCT is good too.",
  "can you speak a little louder?",
  "that's FOOD.",
  "i like PERSON as well.",
  "anyway, i'm still happy i left.",
  "i can ind of see that.",
  "yes i wonder about that too.",
  "not at all, but you get what you pay for.",
  "i think it's weird they'd have to have a LAW about it.",
  "please, go right ahead.",
  "we moved here when i was fourteen.",
  "you know that everybody notices how beautiful you are, don't you?",
  "im sure it is.",
  "i've heard that too.",
  "it's july 16,2009.",
  "wow i didn't know that about the OCCUPATION.",
  "i guess they were trying to make sure they were prepared!",
  "you might be right actually.",
  "i have some FOOD.",
  "yeah i totally agree.",
  "i don't know what to sat about that.",
  "he's also the highest paid OCCUPATION.",
  "no i did not know that!!",
  "i have bought a few PRODUCT.",
  "$ 14,500.",
  "that seems unreal.",
  "all processed FOOD are out.",
  "ok with me.",
  "he said not to bother coming back.",
  "not sure i totally agree with that",
  "i dont think thats possible.",
  "i totally agree!!",
  "i think it is crazy that when BUSINESS went down in 2013.",
  "speaking of PRODUCT.",
  "that ’ s what i can do.",
  "ha i did not know that.",
  "i hope i can live to see that.",
  "right i do remember reading that when he was sworn in he did not use the PRODUCT",
  "ok, but please hurry.",
  "i do once in a while.",
  "i didnt really hear about that.",
  "this is our LOCATION.",
  "i hope so, too.",
  "maybe they don't like what they see and they could contact us...",
  "yes, right over here.",
  "you too...",
  "they have to be.",
  "how many ACADEMIC_DISCIPLINE do they have to study?",
  "so probably not.",
  "sorry, i forgot to mention that i don't like WORK_OF_ART much, either.",
  "it is very ACADEMIC_DISCIPLINE oriented.",
  "i actually do!",
  "well, can't you make it for two only?",
  "that was easy!",
  "PERSON once said.",
  "if you drive on the LOCATION.",
  "well. as good as he was.",
  "i don't know much about the WORK_OF_ART.",
  "for me that's pretty depressing.",
  "do you listen to the PRODUCT very often?",
  "that they are a POLITICAL_PARTY based?",
  "i think the ORG needs to go.",
  "i dont understand why they do not keep up!",
  "very odd!",
  "all right, thank you!",
  "you must be joking.",
  "go lucky!",
  "i would be afraid i would break it....",
  "even more amazing.",
  "well, i think we'd better go now.",
  "then they should hurry.",
  "they really should have.",
  "yeah i mostly get my PRODUCT online too.",
  "did you catch one of the 324 EVENT that they played in 2001?",
  "who knew a PRODUCT could be banned...",
  "no, i haven't.",
  "oh, really.",
  "yes, someone is picking me up.",
  "i don't think i would trust it though.",
  "yes around 180 of them.",
  "i don't know it possible",
  "not as long as it gets fixed.",
  "when will they be here?",
  "and that they believe all of it!",
  "i never know that.",
  "no i have never heard of that at all.",
  "i think they got paid pretty well.",
  "let me handle it.",
  "i would like to make one right now if i can.",
  "oh, god, i've forgotten it.",
  "he isnt even one of the wealthiest OCCUPATION.",
  "performing together has helped too.",
  "ya i would like that.",
  "well, i guess we're all set for another EVENT.",
  "yes he sure does.",
  "i wonder if we ever will?",
  "hmmm i'll watch it then.",
  "i believe PERSON put them back on.",
  "i live in LOCATION.",

  "which program you mostly like?",
  "i'd like to have some FOOD.",
  "have you ever smashed a PRODUCT?",
  "about 33% im told.",
  "i think that was on november 11 according to the PRODUCT.",
  "hilarious!!",
  "you are witty.",
  "yeah it is really handy you can look up PRODUCT on how to do anything",
  "that can be discussed.",
  "oh wow that's pretty cool!",
  "on another ACADEMIC_DISCIPLINE.",
  "did it really?",
  "that is so crazy to think about.",
  "i do know that!",
  "considering it wasn't what i ordered, it was still pretty good.",
  "he really does look like PERSON.",
  "i have it up next in LOCATION.",
  "won't need one if PRODUCT do everything for us.",
  "i prefer PRODUCT personally.",
  "PERSON too..",
  "firstly, it is convenient.",
  "that's cool i will have to check it out.",
  "i much less.",
  "yeah and i wonder how they measure that.",
  "right i agree with you.",
  "don't think so much.",
  "i have heard about it and listened to PRODUCT about it.",
  "it is a new BUSINESS.",
  "i sure did up until it was discontinued in 2003",
  "well it was nice talking with you.",
  "that ’ s not good for me at all.",
  "yes we still do.",
  "no i missed them.",
  "i seriously doubt it.",
  "of his.",
  "i am sure he dances but i have not seen him do it.",
  "right exactly.",
  "it is beautiful you're surrounded by LOCATION everywhere.",
  "i don't know what that means either",
  "yep i need to do that too!",
  "i would have loved to see that.",
  "yeah they were his grandfather's and he made 3 million from them",
  "no but that sounds really cool.",

  "that was also interesting.",
  "that really is.",
  "that would be me.",
  "that is what i thought.",
  "yeah i do for sure.",
  "hmm, how about seven?",
  "it does seem odd.",
  "there ’ s movie?",
  "i do enjoy political WORK_OF_ART.",
  "it must be very relaxing.",
  "then, by LOCATION, please.",
  "toys?",
  "it is amazing to think that he does not get as much.",
  "i know it would be more expensive.",
  "that is quite something.",
  "do you know what was his actual ACADEMIC_DISCIPLINE before he got elected ?",
  "if you were transported to the 30's.",
  "yeah i need to check those out.",
  "i plan to try that soon.",
  "maybe that is for looking around since they don't swim fast.",
  "no i don't why is that?",
  "yes, i will move on to BUSINESS.",
  "i would like to think that it was real.",
  "what are those.",
  "i hear ya.",
  "check the PRODUCT.",
  "no, it will not be formal at all.",
  "they have been studying this since the 70's...",
  "do you like fox news?",
  "yes, that'd be all right.",
  "i ’ m sorry.",
  "right now he plays for the SPORT_TEAM.",
  "they also beat seinfeld!",
  "i know, it does sound pretty awesome.",
  "ah, well.",
  "i have to admit i can't either.",
  "thats why he is my favorite.",
  "who did you vote for?",
  "i've been.",
  "go and try it on.",
  "ya that is kind of scary.",
  "interesting; i did not know that.",
  "just fewer than that.",
  "i know some.",
  "ilike southpark so funny!",
  "definitely that and much more!",
  "how was t stopped by voting?",
  "he passed me by when i was younger.",
  "i can, but not as well as i'd like to.",
  "i think this was definitely made before he was OCCUPATION.",
  "i'll put all that into the PRODUCT for you.",
  "it could sure help.",
  "may i see your id?",
  "$ 100.",
  "all right i'll read it soon.",
  "shouldn't we finish writing this WORK_OF_ART first?",
  "yeah it seems so.",
  "i did see that somewhere.",
  "yeah, it's really unforgettable.",
  "i guess we could bring a PRODUCT.",
  "i can not imagine what that must have felt like!",
  "i'm sure you'll enjoy yourselves.",
  "i bet they do that for mental WORK_OF_ART.",
  "it's coming up quickly!",
  "6.",
  "i only have my PRODUCT tailored.",
  "i'll get them back right away.",
  "i hope so.",
  "i'm sorry to have kept you waiting.",
  "i would have thought that he would stop after the first.",
  "it sounds terrible.",
  "yeah i need to watch it again.",
  "very scary.",
  "i don't usually.",
  "is there something wrong with LOCATION?",
  "i don't like abstract WORK_OF_ART much",
  "even though it is recommended by the ORG?",
  "i am afraid that can't be done.",
  "would you like to register now?",
  "thank you very much and anything else?",
  "ok.here you are.",
  "i could see that happening.",
  "oh i did read that.",
  "i don't watch tv as much as i use to.",
  "thats hard to match i agree.",
  "i completely agree!",
  "that's quite convenient.",
  "that sounds very interesting.",
  "its been good talking to ya.",
  "yeah i don't understand.",
  "that's got to be hard on his PRODUCT.",
  "but.",
  "i don't think i could skate and wear the PRODUCT that they do.",
  "that is very interesting to think about all of the LANGUAGE that have been translated.",
  "be quiet.",
  "why :) would you use it ?",
  "i found that fascinating.",
  "yeah and that was back in 1916.",
  "i think there is only one that exists now.",
  "which one surprises you the most ?",
  "he must be a really popular OCCUPATION and it was cool chatting.",
  "they pay enough.",
  "i want to leave as soon as possible.",
  "yes i would agree with you.",
  "that sounds awesome actually!",
  "very typical PRODUCT.",
  "i love playing TYPE_OF_SPORT too.",
  "it was nice chatting with you as well.",
  "was it LOCATION?",
  "yes, i often go swimming.",
  "well, thank you again for coming to see us.",
  "she told me she liked my new PRODUCT.",
  "well i certainly don't want them to launch at me.",
  "i think i like WORK_OF_ART more.",
  "they practically are a WORK_OF_ART!",
  "yes, look at the WORK_OF_ART i took.",
  "it absolutely was a great FOOD.",
  "they are a little more obscure.",
  "he kind of always knew how good he was.",
  "you know i could go shopping with you sometime if you need it, but can we talk about other ACADEMIC_DISCIPLINE?",
  "yeah she sure is.",
  "wow, isn't that dangerous?",
  "i used to know.",
  "so then, why don't you just go?",
  "do i have to memorize it?",
  "if you ever get to.",
  "why don't you go talk to her?",
  "that's kind of crazy.",
  "it is wow!",
  "i wonder if it's popular in LOCATION.",
  "oh yeah that would be nice.",
  "my favorites!",
  "it takes someone special to be appreciated in WORK_OF_ART.",
  "did you want something to drink?",
  "yeah that seems very odd to me.",
  "i ’ ll take one.",
  "that i can see.",
  "yes, it has.",
  "oh, i've forgotten to tell you.",
  "i was too.",
  "speaking of OCCUPATION.",
  "i would be up for that!",
  "i'll have to check it out.",
  "it must.",
  "look at this FAC.",
  "very much.",
  "yeah i would like to know that as well.",
  "that's a great WORK_OF_ART!",
  "i think that would be overkill.",
  "yeah, it is my favorite.",
  "yeah i'll try to do that.",
  "its interesting how the POLITICAL_PARTY changed in the 1960's",
  "interesting... it was interesting and odd to chat with you.",
  "i read that they are able to play if needed!",
  "so surprising.",
  "it won't be long until your FOOD is delivered.",
  "id don't know that i have seen the ORG.",
  "yeah i guess i could see that.",
  "i don't like how it looks",
  "even more so than PERSON?",
  "i am so happy for them.",
  "oh so they are tied.",
  "i couldn't have watched that long.",
  "i don't remember that one either.",
  "i don't get out as much as i would like to.",
  "no. please.",
  "there isn't such a PRODUCT?",
  "that is interesting!",
  "as you said.",
  "i am jealous!",
  "just PERSON.",
  "well i would also like to visit LOCATION.",
  "what do we do first?",
  "it is very popular.",
  "incredible.",
  "by melting it down and then reforming it.",
  "he is a scientifical OCCUPATION.",
  "just put it on the PRODUCT please.",
  "there is one in the FAC.",
  "i'll talk to you later.",
  "arid and mountainous LOCATION.",
  "i believe it was just used to measure for pouring PRODUCT.",
  "it is really horrible.",
  "yeah i did know.",
  "it definitely is !",
  "what do you think i should do?",
  "er... how about this one?",
  "i heard that it is.",
  "was good talking to you!",
  "ahhh.. nobody will do that.",
  "it is really too bad.",
  "i used to love TYPE_OF_SPORT.",
  "he must be a really smart OCCUPATION.",
  "that must have been one really.",
  "hmm i am not sure how i feel about them",
  "that is funny!",
  "are you suggesting that anyone can be?",
  "that would be really cool to see.",
  "and how long are you depositing for?",
  "speaking of an old PRODUCT.",
  "well considering they're the ORG who most likely discovered it i wouldn't be surprised if they listen to it regularly.",
  "yeah that was not good and all because they were using different PRODUCT.",
  "they still have some catching up to do.",
  "try it and if you can't do it, one of us can always help you later.",
  "oh its probably like PRODUCT.",
  "i think i read that somewhere and found it surprising.",
  "i usually ask them if they want some FOOD and then give them something to eat.",
  "i recently heard that!",
  "it's been great talking to you!",
  "it sounds super expensive!",
  "i have heard of it.",
  "i actually like the FOOD there.",
  "yeah, besides, your LAW will be deducted.",
  "sure, you ’ re more than welcome.",
  "i ’ m glad you finally agree.",
  "do you like ANIMAL?",
  "yes...obviously they sell otherwise he wouldn't have made 3.",
  "what LAW did you get?",
  "i've never heard of it actually.",
  "probably something by ORG.",
  "that would be cool too.",
  "yeah that was really sad.",
  "i do not even want to see it.",
  "cheers!",
  "why don't they drive?",
  "well i'll tell you would always be there to game it up.",
  "i think he is retired.",
  "i didnt think of that.",
  "yes, let's do it.",
  "i have never played it",
  "seems right.",
  "i cant.",
  "you would never guess that these amazing ORG are so nervous.",
  "yeah that's great.",
  "well, that's okay.",
  "yeah i agree with you.",
  "strange considering how popular it was/is.",
  "you ever tried to quit?",
  "well, i don't think much about it.",
  "i know of one i think",
  "oh, i wonder if she ’ ll go for that.",
  "ok.is it convenient for us to come now?",
  "it might.",
  "google noogle!",
  "when are you returning home?",
  "how can we be the ORG?",
  "how long have you been living here?",
  "what are WORK_OF_ART?",
  "but there won't be anything good left.",
  "i wonder what that would sound like?",
  "i watch some here and there.",
  "i think we should keep exploring LOCATION.",
  "i really like it.",
  "yeah. agreed.",
  "that is so funny.",
  "that's FOOD you can smell.",
  "hehe.",
  "no, thank you, we just ate FOOD a little while ago.",
  "you know.",
  "i read that before.",
  "yeah that's definitely not good",
  "that is so nice of him.",
  "yeah he sure was.",
  "i know, but...",
  "i agree that is pretty sad.",
  "it doesn't taste good?",
  "did you catch anything?",
  "yeah but i think i blocked it out.",
  "$10 million bunker?",
  "that would be pretty interesting!",
  "kareem!",
  "i would hope so!",
  "yeah but they think it looks stupid",
  "so we can relax now.",
  "no, you know i can't bear eating less.",
  "i hope you haven ’ t invited any FOOD.",
  "well, i like to play TYPE_OF_SPORT.",
  "yes, their FOOD are enormous.",
  "where do you live in LOCATION?",
  "not really to be honest.",
  "ok.i'll look after it then.",
  "yeah it might be worth it.",
  "i really like that actually.",
  "it's amazing how popular it is.",
  "i think it's EVENT?",
  "might need to have a LOCATION just between the 2 of them.",
  "yes that was him indeed.",
  "in what ACADEMIC_DISCIPLINE do you think they will be the most helpful ?",
  "i miss those sometimes.",
  "that is cool but scary.",
  "don't go in LOCATION.",
  "let's go outside and talk.",
  "i don't know PERSON.",
  "i'm curious to see it as well.",
  "they started back in 1975.",
  "ah that brings me back.",
  "i hope you enjoy it here.",
  "it's 0-7- 7-8- 7-3- 6-7- 6-8- 8.",
  "yea i'll try to find you.",
  "i ’ m sorry, i wasn ’ t supposed to meet you.",
  "i guess they werent an approved PRODUCT to be worn.",
  "ha ha yes i agree.",
  "they are really good\\",
  "i'm surprise iv'e never heard of him.",
  "it was enjoyable when it first came out.",
  "that's very well put.",
  "gotcha!",
  "i meant to say wasn't invited!",
  "i have seen a few of those.",
  "football leagues?",
  "i can understand.",
  "i think i will if they haven't yet!",
  "not necessarily.",
  "how about EVENT.",
  "nope i don't like it.",
  "i'm buckled up.",
  "i heard that he sold the FAC twice!",
  "yeah it is very odd.",
  "i saw that as well and completely agreed with it.",
  "no i didn't i'll have to check that out.",
  "yes, it would be.",
  "that's really cool!",
  "i'm very sorry.",
  "that's really nice.",
  "i'll work hard.",
  "oh didn't know that.",
  "yeah and keeping it free.",
  "how do they get them up there?",
  "can you tell me how to make it?",
  "that sounds like an expensive FOOD.",
  "that sounds funny.",
  "im not one.",
  "it sounds amazing to me.",
  "i don ’ t believe it.",
  "yes, if i were hired, when would you like me to start?",
  "they are far superior.",
  "that's too early.",
  "bye bye!",
  "well i believe that.",
  "no.  he's already tried once and lost.",
  "which was built first?",
  "yeah i would check that out!",
  "you are free.",
  "that's almost unbelievable.",
  "i think i have to know what they sound like too!",
  "it's 112.",
  "yet sometimes they excite us.",
  "yes, that will work out fine.",
  "i do like TYPE_OF_SPORT",
  "yes he is decent.",
  "yeah but then they are also risking losing sometimes just by not practicing that.",
  "its actually really sad.",
  "so you cannot warm up your PRODUCT.",
  "honestly i can't decide.",
  "that's pretty insane.",
  "it sounds like you just need to be more careful.",
  "is that all right?",
  "that might be acceptable.",
  "no, but you never know when you'll need a PRODUCT.",
  "the same to you as well.",
  "i would think.",
  "that is pretty crazy to think about.",
  "that sounds impressive!",
  "how long will it take to get there?",
  "i was surprised to hear about that.",
  "not really except for special EVENT.",
  "oh yes... it's very therapeutic for me!",
  "he did win OCCUPATION.",
  "i do own a PRODUCT.",
  "the stress test song?",
  "yeah, let's do so.",
  "i think i heard about it on the PRODUCT so maybe it isn't 100% true.",
  "i agree with it.",
  "it seems to be pretty effective.",
  "ok, then you need to go to FAC.",
  "i heard that also.",
  "yet the BUSINESS seems old fashioned.",
  "what should we do?",
  "that is a horrible LAW.",
  "yes they are only 2.7 PRODUCT wide.",
  "well, you asked for it.",
  "that is confusing.",
  "we're getting close.",
  "so i couldn't get through.",
  "they can cook them themselves to make sure exactly how they like it.",
  "i'm going to call you soon.",
  "i ’ m glad you are getting better.",
  "oh, very easy.",
  "that FOOD tasted so good!",
  "well that's good to know.",
  "is it illegal?",
  "no, he's retired.",
  "thank you, that will be all.",
  "i would have expected it to be more even as well.",
  "i have to tell you something else that you probably won ’ t like.",
  "i am not sure.",
  "yes, it is the right one.",
  "i think being a ORG would be very stressful.",
  "i know it's crazy.",
  "i wonder if he laughed.",
  "i do agree with that.",
  "it is nice to get away from it.",
  "will do.",
  "i ’ m sure you will enjoy yourselves.",
  "i don't speak LANGUAGE.",
  "certainly...",
  "that sounds great.",
  "i wonder how he fell for that.",
  "try not to take on more than you can handle.",
  "i just learned that recently too.",
  "thats really interesting because as far as i knew.",
  "i want to see a WORK_OF_ART.",
  "i've only seen WORK_OF_ART.",
  "it is unfortunate.",
  "seems like a pretty unique PRODUCT to learn how to play.",
  "whoa!  1844 i just looked it up.",
  "yes, i'm used to being on my own.",
  "that just sounds so strange.",
  "i used to like it.",
  "um.",
  "that is nice that they thought of future WORK_OF_ART.",
  "very happy to chatting with you.",
  "for sure and he was like the original WORK_OF_ART that everyone loved.",
  "it's just too bad.",
  "yes but i found it to be quite expensive.",
  "alright, please show me what you have.",
  "i can't pretend to understand all the ACADEMIC_DISCIPLINE behind it.",
  "we will get over this.",
  "i heard that he died recently.",
  "do you watch much telly.",
  "wow that is very fast",
  "he deserves the OCCUPATION.",
  "is that the PRODUCT you use here?",
  "you don't have anything bad to say about her?",
  "i think it came out in like 1997.",
  "whew.",
  "ha ha ha!",
  "i could not.",
  "i liked it also.",
  "i don ’ t agree with you.",
  "yes i am.",
  "i do like to travel but am afraid to travel internationally.",
  "no. didn't know that one.",
  "yeah i think that's how they do it.",
  "well he still wore the PRODUCT.",
  "nice. good for them.",
  "true!",
  "where will we call at?",
  "that doesnt sound nice.",
  "i sure didnt know that.",
  "as soon as he started to run for OCCUPATION.",
  "there are a few LOCATION.",
  "just asking?",
  "not sure what that means either.",
  "i'm going to get to sleep eventually.",
  "i can tell you worked hard on it.",
  "you should really drink FOOD.",
  "only the SPORTS_SEASON.",
  "its very helpful.",
  "yeah i would have to agree.",
  "that i did not like.",
  "that's trail mix!",
  "they would have to be pretty durable.",
  "he created it with nixon!",
  "that's not bad.",
  "no, i'm afraid not now.",
  "i saw a WORK_OF_ART of one where it ate something so big",
  "i bet you'll still buy it, though.",
  "i hope you can come to our BUSINESS to work.",
  "it looks so beautiful.",
  "i wouldn't think so either.",
  "that doesn't seem fair.",
  "and it's beneficial.",
  "yes, but sometimes he is just not reasonable.",
  "yes, i ’ m. are you LANGUAGE, too?",
  "oh yes definitely.",
  "we don't know actually.",
  "not that much.",
  "i think it's too slow makes me sleepy.",
  "why did you do that?",
  "he was smart.",
  "not surprised.",
  "you forgot all of about it, didn't you?",
  "they are all very experienced and great TYPE_OF_SPORT.",
  "good bye!",
  "it's like a PRODUCT.",
  "well, i ’ m looking to get a custom-made PRODUCT.",
  "i am sure they will be pleased.",
  "i want to get a big PRODUCT and buy a little of everything.",
  "yes that is reserved for special EVENT",
  "oh, i ’ m sorry to hear that.",
  "well interestingly.",
  "i've been great.",
  "you need to fill out this PRODUCT, please.",
  "what are you studying?",
  "i had not realized that.",
  "let's sing it together, shall we?",
  "that would have been neat to see!",
  "very little.",
  "i love them .",
  "i do like some of it.",
  "sit down.",
  "PRODUCT is quite hard.",
  "well, how about BUSINESS?",
  "i have been into MUSIC_GENRE recently.",
  "i wish i could tell you yes, but no, there isn't.",
  "no, nothing changed.",
  "now what am i supposed to do?",
  "that was interesting!",
  "it's cheaper if i don't buy one.",
  "that works too lol.",
  "we probably should.",
  "yes, how can i help you?",
  "yeah i didn't see it.",
  "sounds somewhat interesting.",
  "not to mention steve kerr!",
  "not that i'm aware of.",
  "it should.",
  "kind of bizarre.",
  "that is pretty ingenious.",
  "i never had any.",
  "we can do that.",
  "i guess they were very efficient about programming that PRODUCT.",
  "we used to be really close, but that all changed once she moved to LOCATION.",
  "if it had a great PRODUCT and fairly priced i probably would.",
  "just do like this.",
  "i wonder how far that would be and if it is designed like the LOCATION.",
  "well.. it is the ORG!",
  "what about some FOOD?",
  "yes. agree.",
  "very few.",
  "i didn't hear anything about it.",
  "i heard they weigh 356 PRODUCT.",
  "u 2",
  "well, yes, there is something wrong actually.",
  "so they don't allow motorized PRODUCT at all?",
  "frankly, he is more well-behaved than you.",
  "it's likely to happen eventually.",
  "sure, we wouldn't miss that for anything.",
  "it does seem interesting.",
  "but most are not underperforming.",
  "not that i can think of.",
  "i think i can believe it.",
  "that is absolutely crazy.",
  "that's pretty lame!",
  "wow how did you meet her?",
  "i am familiar with it",
  "i don't see that happening especially with who the current OCCUPATION is",
  "i used to watch that when i was younger.",
  "i don't either really.",
  "sorry, it had been sold out.",
  "it was quite transcendent.",
  "i think you are right now that you mention that.",
  "it is impressive how huge it has become.",
  "more than 750!!!",
  "i have heard that and parrots too!",
  "have you checked your PRODUCT recently?",
  "do you mean financially rewarding?",
  "um.. i don ’",
  "OCCUPATION are generally savvy.",
  "that's kind of odd?",
  "they definitely sound like it!",
  "i read that too!",
  "not always.",
  "that is an amazing WORK_OF_ART.",
  "how long will you be staying in the uk?",
  "same here have a good one",
  "yes otherwise you would be voiding its LAW",
  "it should be easy to find.",
  "that sounds nice.",
  "i can see that.",
  "nice sounds like a good SPORTS_VENUE.",
  "sometimes you need it.",
  "i do not like PERSON.",
  "if i were dancing WORK_OF_ART.",
  "have you found anything nice yet?",
  "i am thinking it must have been.",
  "i havent either.",
  "oh, what is it?",
  "sure, then.",
  "yes, it's really wonderful!",
  "i like ORG too!",
  "i wonder how that would worl.",
  "okay, i will try it on.",
  "i'll just have this all wrapped up for you.",
  "i actually do.. like you said.",
  "i didn't notice.",
  "i do not have one.",
  "i ’ m sorry to say no.",
  "what would even be crazier would be if the MUSIC_GENRE was actually good",
  "thats located in the d.LOCATION.wow i didnt know.",
  "yes he still claims to be really good at PRODUCT",
  "it is with PERSON and he is in it.",
  "maybe i could avoid the LOCATION.",
  "i can so that.",
  "i dont know what happened there.",
  "ya he was the best.",
  "i think that would be so neat.",
  "that is very weird i will agree.",
  "i am one of those.",
  "oh i bet they do.",
  "i'll have to try that!",
  "how long will the EVENT take?",
  "i agree with you on that one.",
  "do you think they stopped it?",
  "for us based NORP i am very familiar.",
  "it seems too short.",
  "and we talked about ORG before.",
  "then we've got to get going.",
  "i learned that reading this PRODUCT .",
  "that's too much.",
  "do you live with your ORG?",
  "i have not?",
  "it would have been amazing to witness those.",
  "i have not seen them.",
  "so how long did you stay?",
  "or someone bought it out so they couldn't produce them.",
  "yeah i do like that MUSIC_GENRE.",
  "no he wont release them.",
  "i dont know if it were me.",
  "yes perhaps they did.",
  "the canadian rock singer?",
  "oh no.",
  "i guess he would have been pretty rich then too.",
  "in WORK_OF_ART it has been fun.",
  "i disremember if it was.",
  "do you like it here so far?",
  "i do not know actually.",
  "how silly.",
  "like i said before.",
  "uk version?",
  "what do you mean by ORG?",
  "we are lucky to play in a new SPORTS_VENUE.",
  "they like to dig and sniff around a LOCATION outside.",
  "i'll buy the moisturizing PRODUCT and cleansing gel first.",
  "yes, we can, but it isn ’ t very interesting.",
  "i agree it would.",
  "i guess it was a popular PRODUCT.",
  "perhaps they do.",
  "PERSON also played harmonica.",
  "it is cheap.",
  "that surprised me too.",
  "i think you can if you use an PRODUCT.",
  "i find them fascinating.",
  "that's what made it so great.",
  "its not surprising for a main WORK_OF_ART.",
  "well depends how you define TYPE_OF_SPORT i guess.",
  "i didn't mean to.",
  "i'm impressed that the ORG is choosing to work there.",
  "PRODUCT.",
  "i think WORK_OF_ART still exists.",
  "i know it is popular.",
  "look at us now.",
  "they do indeed.",
  "i didn't think you would be interested.",
  "she's pretty easy to get along with.",
  "i'm glad to know that you like her.",
  "ok.no problem.",
  "dark, maybe dark blue maybe black.",
  "i've never seen it.",
  "the NATION are seditious.",
  "i'll return at about 4:30 pm.",
  "she's ten.",
  "you know what would make for great tv.",
  "thats true i suppose.",
  "there's too many to name for me.",
  "i'll have to listen to them i suppose.",
  "ok, what's next then?",
  "yeah that would have been crazy.",
  "i actually like it.",
  "it was actually PERSON.",
  "it is in LOCATION.",
  "you shouldn't work so hard.",
  "something about ACADEMIC_DISCIPLINE.",
  "i didn't even know they were still performing to be honest.",
  "sounds strange.",
  "it could have been.",
  "maybe something about TYPE_OF_SPORT made him philosophical.",
  "it is, but it's very rewarding.",
  "i would be so angry at myself.",
  "what should i avoid?",
  "that would have been epic.",
  "it seems so.",
  "that too.",
  "that's basically it.",
  "yeah i would like to go to that one actually.",
  "i wonder that too.",
  "yes it can cost you as much as $300 to travel across.",
  "i've never taken this PRODUCT, but i think it's the right one.",
  "i had read that!",
  "i'll get used to not seeing my ORG.",
  "ugh!",
  "i guess it vibrates and the PRODUCT are amplified.",
  "i believe it will.",
  "i also see it can be played offline.",
  "that is very interesting and i think you are right.",
  "someone had to do it!",
  "i think they call him OCCUPATION right?",
  "ha. BUSINESS before tv",
  "yes i did know that.",
  "i prefer PRODUCT as well.",
  "that is how they are trying to control the OCCUPATION.",
  "i think they should remake it.",
  "i am surprised they considered shutting down.",
  "thats so funny.",
  "i bet it isn't much!",
  "i wonder if PRODUCT is still around.",
  "it would be kind of boring.",
  "that could happen.",
  "with ACADEMIC_DISCIPLINE really.",
  "i have!",
  "am i through now?",
  "i'm not at all convinced.",
  "let's go!",
  "yeah if to of those WORK_OF_ART get stuck together.",
  "they usually taste sweet, but they remind me of an FOOD.",
  "rain man?",
  "i don't think i've seen any.",
  "they say it's made in LOCATION.",
  "i can show it to you now, if you like.",
  "yeah i want to know more about that too",
  "i have a PRODUCT that i play now.",
  "sort of WORK_OF_ART.",
  "its our WORK_OF_ART i guess.",
  "yeah i thought the PRODUCT was awesome!",
  "yes like PERSON would not surprise me either.",
  "that sounds interesting to read.",
  "yeah it is pretty scary.",
  "did you hear of ORG?",
  "right... anything else?",
  "i do not know anyone who would wear one.",
  "sorry, it's not available now.",
  "as they should be!",
  "yeah i should look them up on PRODUCT later.",
  "i was totally surprised when i read an PRODUCT about it.",
  "they are pretty long and drawn out!",
  "i try to watch the CHAMPIONSHIP.",
  "i never saw the WORK_OF_ART to be honest.",
  "i always thought that too!",
  "i guess it doesnt translate well.",
  "i played in hs.",
  "odenkirk?",
  "how are you going to do that?",
  "and when do you prepare for your final LAW?",
  "i can't even imagine that many but i suppose it is true.",
  "i think everybody pretty much has that right.",
  "wow, it is quite far away from here.",
  "i know what i am doing.",
  "what do i do now?",
  "something is quite wrong about that.",
  "i'm glad.",
  "ok i'll have to check that out.",
  "i feel like if i was going to watch it.",
  "i can see the WORK_OF_ART.",
  "it looks nice.",
  "there just isn't enough affordable LOCATION to go around.",
  "final space?",
  "well i assume your in the us.",
  "maybe the ORG is already used to it.",
  "that is only going to grow.",
  "but speaking of us OCCUPATION.",
  "that's ok.if you want the photo i will mail it to you.",
  "i was denied a LAW?",
  "hes a pretty good qb as well",
  "ya you're right.",
  "he must be i guess.",
  "actually no.",
  "you could read as fast as PERSON.",
  "i wonder what his OCCUPATION was?",
  "hmm..",
  "because that would be mean.",
  "i guess he invetend it at the ORG!",
  "since 1989.",
  "just watching some TYPE_OF_SPORT.",
  "i've seen it but don't follow it close.",
  "the us needs one of those!",
  "you too buddy!",
  "that must be expensive!",
  "i think i've heard of her but don't know too much.",
  "have you exercised strenuously or played TYPE_OF_SPORT recently?",
  "how do you work with a ORG?",
  "i guess there is a legal LAW.",
  "i heard about that...",
  "so what are you responsible for?",
  "well too bad we are not in LOCATION.",
  "i;m going to head over to watch it now.",
  "that's very busy.",
  "yeah they must have been.",
  "so if i can help you as a OCCUPATION, what is in for me?",
  "did you ever get into the ORG?",
  "i'll have to check it out sometime.",
  "that would explain it for sure.",
  "that would be really cool.",
  "i used to.",
  "very useful PRODUCT, i will try them right now.",
  "oh that's awesome.",
  "could you spell that, please?",
  "yeah i would need to confirm it with BUSINESS!",
  "they are good for that and pretty much everything else.",
  "i think that they are fine.",
  "just about.",
  "you should have moved out long, long ago.",
  "i've never ridden a ANIMAL.",
  "ha probably why he is a OCCUPATION.",
  "TYPE_OF_SPORT can be good.",
  "i don't know but it does seem like it would take a while.",
  "i guess being a OCCUPATION like that causes one to be very paranoid.",
  "i kind of like it.",
  "that was one of the first modern WORK_OF_ART i saw.",
  "i heard about that but am still confused as to why he did that.",
  "i agree that would be cool!",
  "wow exactly thats crazy.",
  "maybe we'll chat again sometime!",
  "he's all right.",
  "i have not listen to it.",
  "it is crazy how dominant they have been.",
  "in 1924.",
  "it definitely might take me a while!",
  "i think it's great.",
  "that would be lovely.",
  "because its' the back LOCATION.",
  "hmm. don't know if they make that there.",
  "i watch TYPE_OF_SPORT sometimes.",
  "please go ahead, i am listening.",
  "yeah i have played the PRODUCT.",
  "well, there are some WORK_OF_ART that come up.",
  "i would really like to know what MUSIC_GENRE that is",
  "well, let me look again.",
  "i couldn ’ t even if i wanted to.",
  "well, i really like dancing.",
  "it's kind of you to say.",
  "yeah, we did get off too early.",
  "what ’ s the time?",
  "we still have six left.",
  "maybe once the ORG gets involved who knows what it would have become.",
  "i believe it's in LOCATION!",
  "i think a regular visitor's LAW should suffice.",
  "it sure was.",
  "ha ha well i guess they didn't live long enough to get mesothelioma.",
  "did you drive yourself to the FAC?",
  "thats crazy.",
  "wow. never had a pet ANIMAL?",
  "with me being of NATION decent myself.",
  "i ’ ll get started on it now.",
  "he is a great TYPE_OF_SPORT.",
  "i have a PRODUCT.",
  "not much actual tv.",
  "it might be.",
  "well you could always listen on the PRODUCT.",
  "wow they must've been so smart.",
  "yeah i think that is pretty funny though.",
  "i never heard of it.",
  "that's not exactly true.",
  "am.",
  "thats so many.",
  "yeah he is a scary WORK_OF_ART that is true.",
  "sure, here you are.",
  "seems hard to believe right now.",
  "i bet not too well lol.",
  "i recently read something about that.",
  "yeah or i'm sure i could find something by them on PRODUCT.",
  "running back named PERSON.",
  "ln this PRODUCT, we sell it for 53.95.",
  "good to know.",
  "but you ’ re in LOCATION.",
  "they're still doing pretty good i think.",
  "i can only imagine.",
  "well, i think you ’ re pretty lucky actually.",
  "i guess i've never tried to separate one.",
  "how old is the FAC then?",
  "i enjoy the PRODUCT but i am not passionate about it.",
  "yeah they have become huge for sure.",
  "oh, tell me about it.",
  "they can't spell, they can't add, they can't subtract, they even don't remember any more.",
  "ironic and somewhat sad.",
  "he's not my favorite.",
  "i like my older PRODUCT as well.",
  "you know i have never been on a ANIMAL.",
  "oh good we are almost there.",
  "you know i had heard that",
  "i enjoyed it.",
  "well i do have BUSINESS.",
  "ya that would be annoying.",
  "ANIMAL.",
  "i can not belive that.",
  "thats actually in the us.",
  "i wonder how that works?",
  "it was smart.",
  "yes, but nothing's happened.",
  "and my new PRODUCT.",
  "well, i talk to myself.",
  "pcc is perfectly fine for me.",
  "you mean i have to pay now?",
  "yep it truly is .",
  "it's funny.",
  "is that legal in the us?",
  "panhandling can be quite profitable.",
  "she did?",
  "with jon stewart?",
  "i wonder if they're covered by the LOCATION continuously moving down there?",
  "yea i've read that before",
  "oh, it's nothing to speak of.",
  "i should watch it again.",
  "i can't decide which i like better.",
  "it's complicated.",
  "i wonder why that's illegal?",
  "he was wearing a WORK_OF_ART.",
  "that would be scary for sure.",
  "no, not really run them.",
  "that's quite reasonable.",
  "i lease a PRODUCT.",
  "the least expensive, but still fully functional.",
  "yeah, but i was afraid to fall back asleep.",
  "i heard of him before!",
  "i do and i do know that.",
  "i hate it and i was about to withdrawal.",
  "i love that as it spread throughout the LOCATION.",
  "oh, will you?",
  "it surely does.",
  "the PRODUCT are excellent.",
  "i don't think i forgot anything.",
  "now that is what i call WORK_OF_ART.",
  "i didn't know that about PERSON.",
  "i don't appreciate abstract WORK_OF_ART much now.",
  "well it was nice talking to you!!",
  "that us pretty amazing.",
  "that sounds fun.",
  "yes, i've paid all of them off.",
  "well that's good to know!",
  "i use mine somewhat.",
  "good, yes, your PRODUCT are a little swollen and red.",
  "yeah i heard PERSON was pretty good too.",
  "he was great in house.",
  "why are you so pessimistic?",
  "and don't fall for all the over-commercialized PRODUCT.",
  "i know im excited for that PRODUCT.",
  "when we finally decided to ask someone, they told us we were in LOCATION.",
  "i ’ ll stand in with you if you like.",
  "i ’ m afraid i have to go now.",
  "we have EVENT every saturday from june to october.",
  "just fill it up with regular, unleaded, please.",
  "thats just insane.",
  "the PRODUCT was special.",
  "no i do not know anything about him.",
  "they were ORG.",
  "that it is.",
  "that's pretty weird of him.",
  "i agree with you on that one!",
  "i got two.",
  "i'd rather not.",
  "thats too funny.",
  "that is very shocking!",
  "maybe they should have planned that a little better!",
  "i'll call him and tell him you're here.",
  "i'm still just surprised you really want to do it.",
  "i really like the ORG.",
  "are you?",
  "yes good chatting with you as well",
  "do you use PRODUCT?",
  "yes, very interesting FOOD...",
  "huh. never heard that before.",
  "i commute so i always have the PRODUCT on.",
  "is it full?",
  "actually it was WORK_OF_ART.",
  "that's terrifying.",
  "yeah it was really good.",
  "ok, i'll wrap it for you.",
  "i just think it would be cool to ride in a PRODUCT just once.",
  "that's really not fair.",
  "how much can you FOOD?",
  "yeah i am looking forward to it",
  "yeah, try not to kick or hit the PRODUCT!",
  "i totally agree there.",
  "no i don't actually.",
  "he is a good qb.",
  "i prefer FOOD.",
  "those FOOD sound great.",
  "and has released 3 WORK_OF_ART already.",
  "you want to be beautiful, don't you?",
  "i don't know if he is.",
  "i've got to run.",
  "that's impressive.",
  "oh... TYPE_OF_SPORT.",
  "i could teach you how to cook something healthy.",
  "they're so smart!",
  "no, it ’ s FOOD.",
  "just the FOOD will be fine, thank you.",
  "they're cute.",
  "i did know about that.",
  "no but it should be.",
  "sir?",
  "i would probably win that EVENT.",
  "i think you're onto something!",
  "ho, no!",
  "i hope we can too.",
  "i would love to see his WORK_OF_ART.",
  "yeah and he too did very well",
  "i believe it was because he was the only one.",
  "i have seen those.",
  "i feel like i have to search for that too.",
  "overall.",
  "yeah, you are so lucky to have found each other.",
  "we're terribly sorry for that.",
  "i wasnt aware of that.",
  "yea they probably would eat.",
  "i can ’ t believe this!",
  "and here i am.",
  "i think it may be coming out on PRODUCT soon.",
  "that's true for me.",
  "indeed i do.",
  "if you live by the LOCATION.",
  "i wish he would have been.",
  "oh really nice..",
  "that is actually so little.",
  "i ’ m so sorry to hear that.",
  "i understand the ACADEMIC_DISCIPLINE on that but it just seems crazy.",
  "i've heard about that, but i've never tried it.",
  "i loved the PRODUCT.",
  "that ’ s all.",
  "yeah, i don't mind it either.",
  "just as you advertised in the BUSINESS.",
  "and 58 million BUSINESS in the us alone.",
  "let me just grab your PRODUCT.",
  "and they hardly shed so you don't have to worry about the FOOD or anything like that",
  "i used to like him",
  "yeah maybe the PRODUCT wasn't good?",
  "i would assume not.",
  "i am going to also.",
  "nope i don't like PRODUCT much.",
  "when, did you say?",
  "i do not think i have come across them.",
  "some of them are yes.",
  "oh wow i did not know that.",
  "so, you'd better wear this PRODUCT and you will sleep well.",
  "well, you can't blame them.",
  "and i can choose any PRODUCT?",
  "anything else i should know?",
  "i have when i was younger!",
  "here is my driver's LAW.",
  "that is actually amazing.",
  "huh... i think 7 % is little high that might be hard to do.",
  "where can we get PRODUCT?",
  "don't they practice for those WORK_OF_ART?",
  "that's terrible.",
  "that always baffles me.",
  "ok.there is one on wednesday.",
  "yeah she is pretty impressive.",
  "you are very modest.",
  "i've always wondered why they do that.",
  "i wonder what bk hoped to achieve by that.",
  "maybe he didn't tell anyone he made it.",
  "i never knew that he was that smart.",
  "no, he doesn't!!!",
  "PERSON claimed that he went to heaven.",
  "i sure do they are good PRODUCT.",
  "it would have been.",
  "i hope this doesn't happen again.",
  "oh well.",
  "it promises to be more reliable and faster.",
  "what PRODUCT do you wear?",
  "have you had anything to eat?",
  "i dont think that WORK_OF_ART can actually enact anything.",
  "i wonder why that has never been adapted.",
  "well, i ddin't think so at first.",
  "oh okay.",
  "no, i don't know where the BUSINESS is.",
  "i saw it.",
  "i didn't know that before but now i do!",
  "yeah and we both know we don't want to end up like that.",
  "yes !",
  "yes, let me put it on the PRODUCT.",
  "how about a PRODUCT?",
  "not sure why it would be so secret.",
  "i \"like\" that!",
  "i got to wonder what the OCCUPATION was thinking there.",
  "i can help you with it",
  "that would have been nice to find.",
  "i don know about that",
  "i haven't used it.",
  "ya you know you're gonna get caught.",
  "just asking?!",
  "no, i don't often dance.",
  "this PRODUCT is so pretty.",
  "i know that currently.",
  "it looks great, but you need something to go with it.",
  "do you like any other TYPE_OF_SPORT?",
  "isn't there also one in LOCATION?",
  "it is very interesting to hear.",
  "no, don ’ t use them, please.",
  "here we are, miss.",
  "thats an interesting PRODUCT.",
  "i think it's still pretty popular.",
  "its 1886.",
  "then you need to type in your PRODUCT.",
  "mr. robot.",
  "and yet among all those.",
  "that sounds kind of bogus to me.",
  "how would i go about applying for this ORG?",
  "they're very good at working together.",
  "from a LOCATION of about 20.",
  "that sounds like a great FOOD.",
  "huh?",
  "i'll look for it.",
  "sorry, i'll try to speak louder.",
  "and it's a PRODUCT?",
  "i havent heard of that PRODUCT.",
  "so convenient.",
  "anything to drink?",
  "i don't blame her.",
  "wow weird i wonder why i've never heard that before.",
  "i would definitely.",
  "PERSON originally was supposed to be in it.",
  "neopets?",
  "that ’ s too bad.",
  "i need it sooner.",
  "then they moved it to like 15",
  "yeah that is curious for sure.",
  "yeah he is not up there with PERSON",
  "i actually like the new WORK_OF_ART.",
  "i want to see what's in there.",
  "in my NORP it should be renamed anyway.",
  "is that what you really think?",
  "that PRODUCT is something i can get behind!",
  "i think i have.",
  "i like that she wanted to do the triple axel so bad that she dreamed she could .",
  "i use it about everyday.",
  "i actually think that would be an interesting PRODUCT to watch!",
  "yeah they are awesome.",
  "i bet that it would be a good PRODUCT too.",
  "yes, we called, but it is booked up.",
  "who isn't?",
  "but now you are rich.",
  "that certainly sounds like a dreary saturday.",
  "i'm afraid it is.",
  "i haven't heard that one or at least i can recall listening to it.",
  "well, i guess no ORG can help me but myself.",
  "i think they should.",
  "hopefully, he will be.",
  "ya i don't like it its very boring.",
  "didn't they do that back in WORK_OF_ART?",
  "i did not know that they had over 2m PRODUCT.",
  "how long have they been working on it?",
  "here's the BUSINESS.",
  "no actually i did not know that.",
  "i wonder what that sounds like?",
  "not to mention MUSIC_GENRE.",
  "i am sure.",
  "that would be annoying.",
  "she grew up on a LOCATION.",
  "i think i had that one...",
  "is she really?",
  "i was born in LOCATION.",
  "i just heard about it recently.",
  "oh yeah definitely is.",
  "he used to say.",
  "i think we can climb to the LOCATION, can't we?",
  "is this true?",
  "and now the BUSINESS is valuing at $104 billion.",
  "are you from the LOCATION?",
  "i did like that one.",
  "make sure they are fresh.",
  "i do not know",
  "i would make her buy me PRODUCT that cost 100 or more.",
  "dont remind me.",
  "i'm not sure what LOCATION it is.",
  "the BUSINESS is awesome.",
  "that is interesting because they probably had very opposing NORP.",
  "oh i havent seen those.",
  "he is versatile.",
  "i heard about it?",
  "i know that's kind of odd he would do that?",
  "yep i agree with you there.",
  "actually, i have applied to several BUSINESS recently.",
  "me either honestly.",
  "thanos sucks!",
  "we wear them too.",
  "he's fine.",
  "i would guess it was during although i'm not sure.",
  "never.",
  "yeah that is quite interesting that they do that.",
  "it should be around that, if you like, please for a free to read the PRODUCT while you are wait.",
  "what LOCATION did you transfer from?",
  "i have an PRODUCT too.",
  "many of them must be really bad.",
  "hmmmm....that's interesting.",
  "here you go?",
  "i guess you could use a PRODUCT?",
  "i don't care about any of that.",
  "yeah i am envious of him.",
  "it was the first EVENT.",
  "i don't know him.",
  "i think you may be on to something.",
  "what can i do?",
  "where did you go to LOCATION?",
  "no they really don't",
  "i read somewhere they foolishly turned down an LAW to buy them for $75 million.",
  "20 years!",
  "he threw an PRODUCT at her.",
  "yeah she sure does.",
  "the most important is that it is very convenient.",
  "then shall we keep pure WORK_OF_ART?",
  "wow she is barely mentioned ever.",
  "yes, i suppose.",
  "someone must be kicking themselves.",
  "i do i am pretty eclectic.",
  "no i didnt know.",
  "well he is rich so he probably knows how to throw a EVENT.",
  "i haven't played much TYPE_OF_SPORT to be honest.",
  "sounds like something he would do.",
  "i wonder if it could make them FOOD too lol",
  "yes. sounds very difficult to write.",
  "FOOD makes me feel relaxed.",
  "addicted?",
  "i cant recall that either.",
  "it was scary, but it felt great, too.",
  "i imagine he was still proud to have been there though.",
  "i think that is correct.",
  "i like both",
  "i have it already.",
  "she is definitely an interesting WORK_OF_ART.",
  "personally i have been listening to PERSON more lately",
  "i heard about it.",
  "maybe because something bigger and scarier ate them all.",
  "LOCATION didn't quite selling it until 2003.",
  "he was very talented!",
  "i've never heard of one!",
  "all i remember about it is that PERSON is in it.",
  "i'll take them.",
  "it's not so bad.",
  "i don't know much about PRODUCT.",
  "i did",
  "it may have been.",
  "ah that is weird.",
  "yes i agree there.",
  "no, it's free.",
  "i'm not sure why.",
  "i wear them sometimes.",
  "i am sure you will.",
  "when did they do that?",
  "let me show you.",
  "oh that is really weird.",
  "i would want to google it on the PRODUCT.",
  "it's not as simple as that.",
  "i also have a PRODUCT.",
  "i heard them state it publically.",
  "i'm shocked that they still send out that many dvd's.",
  "and he was so famous - he was popular and compassionate.",
  "that may be what i ’ m going to do.",
  "yes, i know.",
  "they must have really mad him mad!",
  "yeah in 2012 and he was 25 by then.",
  "then what do you deal with?",
  "i am reading the PERSON on him now.",
  "which is shocking to me.",
  "she is really something.",
  "for my ORG as well.",
  "it is stupid to say so.",
  "oh wow that is surprising!",
  "that is very hard to believe!",
  "that is pretty cool of them to do.",
  "yeah that is pretty crazy.",
  "only sometimes.",
  "i do not use it either to watch on PRODUCT.",
  "how about summer?",
  "i think it is nice too!",
  "i have not seen it either.",
  "six WORK_OF_ART.",
  "yeah i've seen them too.",
  "ACADEMIC_DISCIPLINE is advancing so fast",
  "pretty sure i remember him pinch hitting.",
  "so that is how that got going.",
  "how about this.",
  "i totally agree with you!",
  "i'd hope not either.",
  "yes, i know that.",
  "i think that's a good LAW.",
  "where exactly have you been working, please?",
  "i would never climb up there.",
  "sounds perfect.",
  "i knew, but i couldn't myself.",
  "what are we going to do now?",
  "yes, but not always.",
  "do you like PERSON at all?",
  "i would think the PRODUCT isn't updated.",
  "well enjoy that!",
  "i wonder why he's allowed back",
  "even that PRODUCT would creep me out!",
  "don ’ t be so sure.",
  "thats what i was thinking it could be better used for!",
  "that would be cool!",
  "probably so that they are not threatened in public LOCATION.",
  "if he is.",
  "since you already paid for your LAW, you don't have to pay again.",
  "that would be very crazy.",
  "you certainly deserve it.",
  "dunno.",
  "why does it not?",
  "yes i liked it",
  "not sure what he was thinking.",
  "unfortunately it will likely happen again.",
  "i guess you are pretty young.",
  "yeah, sometimes.",
  "they sound like ORG.",
  "we don't use yellow PRODUCT.",
  "no i didnt know that either.",
  "that is really convenient.",
  "true indeed.",
  "and he refused that LAW.",
  "i started LOCATION somewhere else.",
  "will you go and visit them?",
  "how many OCCUPATION has she won?",
  "is she strict?",
  "that i find hard to believe.",
  "that is so awesome.",
  "yes, if we're busy.",
  "i didn't know that but i bet it would have been funny!",
  "yeah... that is just so hard to believe quite honestly?",
  "i ’ m on it!",
  "do you think you can get me there seven thirty?",
  "if he had.",
  "i think i read that too.",
  "never heard of it but would be funny to see how they did.",
  "i figure they should not run for OCCUPATION.",
  "i wonder what he bought.",
  "i always have FOOD outside, because i ’ m not good at cooking.",
  "it's like you said.",
  "keep walking till you pass the FAC, then turn right.",
  "i don't think it can be avoided, to be honest.",
  "i get it.",
  "i'm supposed to work on a PRODUCT that'd due on monday.",
  "yes have you been to LOCATION?",
  "i can't agree more.",
  "he is.",
  "apparently what we are doing to our ORG might not be as damaging to them as we think.",
  "i think it is because he is a little off.",
  "do you really think i should wear different PRODUCT?",
  "it would be up to you and me.",
  "no i think they determined it didn't happen.",
  "sounds as if you come from a professional ORG.",
  "yeah i can believe that too.",
  "no why?",
  "i never knew that either!",
  "i wonder if he came up with 'to be or not to be.'",
  "even PERSON gets it.",
  "please wait for us even if we're a little late.",
  "wow, you are so lucky.",
  "i like him somewhat.",
  "is that expensive?",
  "that's very interesting! ...",
  "you get any cool PRODUCT you want.",
  "talking about PRODUCT.",
  "i don't know anything about that.",
  "it's insane.",
  "ok.i promise.",
  "not really but then again.",
  "the WORK_OF_ART are amazing.",
  "i'm not a ORG.",
  "do you also like TYPE_OF_SPORT?",
  "are you even listening?",
  "i guess LOCATION would be ideal for you.",
  "oh, i didn't expect you to know them.",
  "she became so successful.",
  "certainly, it is very nice talking with you.",
  "i think i'll have to watch it.",
  "it would be cool.",
  "it is quite a peculiar TYPE_OF_SPORT.",
  "yes, they're right.",
  "1",
  "i haven't seen anything on it.",
  "do you ever use amazon.com?",
  "i like so you think you can dance.",
  "i seent them.",
  "i know he is very central to show",
  "i think he did!",
  "it scares me too.",
  "i hope a few more.",
  "i hope you voted for him.",
  "sounds exciting.",
  "we must find out!",
  "i bet there will be too.",
  "that's awesome and really progressive.",
  "that sounds interesting!",
  "is there anything you can do for me?",
  "i've heard of them.",
  "i can understand that...",
  "i think it would definitely be unconventional!",
  "anything is possible i guess.",

  "that's extremely accommodating.",
  "yeah thats interesting.",
  "it wasn't that loud.",
  "71% NORP i believe.",
  "hey, look at the PRODUCT.",
  "what made you decide to get into PRODUCT?",
  "and it doesn't get any more convenient.",
  "yeah i dont know.",
  "that's so cool.",
  "i have one but the toxic ACADEMIC_DISCIPLINE has begun to get to me and i am on it less and less.",
  "oh, well you don ’ t want this PRODUCT, anyway.",
  "talking about ORG.",
  "in 1978.",
  "i've just started doing my PRODUCT here.",
  "it would be great if we could have more OCCUPATION like him.",
  "yes i suppose they would.",
  "i wish we hadn't come up here.",
  "my youngest did.",
  "yes, if that's all right for you.",
  "what has PERSON been paid to act in?",
  "where will it be?",
  "yes, it does, doesn't it?",
  "he will probably need it eventually.",
  "right .",
  "yes they donated $1 billion.",
  "what else did you see?",
  "yes. isn't that crazy.",
  "why are you being so nice to me?",
  "i don't like them.",

  "so they're easy to remember.",
  "i guess he didn't have tv to distract him either.",
  "i'm off this friday.",
  "i didn't not.",
  "there won't be anyone there to appreciate how cute you are.",
  "seems crazy to me.",
  "i have seen PERSON twice live.",
  "very encouraging!",
  "i am also shockked",
  "i think they need a little PRODUCT.",
  "i hope it never comes to that.",
  "i am volunteering for the ORG.",
  "i would think they would have to!",
  "that would be fun!",
  "something like a PRODUCT.",
  "no...",
  "you need to be able to say whom you worked for and when.",
  "well, tell him to take it easy and that i hope he feels better.",
  "i also wish he deserves more.",
  "yeah and do you know how that came about?",
  "such as?",
  "i assume so.",
  "well... that's a long story.",
  "oh i never knew that.",
  "no, what?",
  "i think he is still married.",
  "i think that is kind of sad.",
  "that really surprised me when i first learned it.",
  "i think it was before 2015.",
  "i read most of it.",
  "i think i'll try it, and give me some green FOOD together.",
  "it's really great to see you again.",
  "yes, tell him mr. PERSON called and ask him to return my called as soon as he back.",
  "yeah he is so funny.",
  "or how they actually recorded it.",
  "i am afraid we have no extra PRODUCT.",
  "ok.i will do that.",
  "i've only done it once.",
  "i  like him.",
  "speaking of WORK_OF_ART.",
  "impressive indeed.",
  "i bet you could!",
  "i think it was with ORG.",
  "you'll find it easily.",
  "they won in 2017 too?",
  "that is light.",
  "just a little.",
  "brady.",
  "i used to but not so much anymore.",
  "it's sunny where i am too.",
  "i think that is in LOCATION.",
  "i was thinking about getting a FOOD.",
  "i can definitely see that.",
  "maybe they did.",
  "he loved LANGUAGE.",
  "they have changed so much since then.",
  "i have and it does work.",
  "or even worse.",
  "nine PRODUCT twenty.",
  "and now they have everything in there.",
  "what do they do with all that LOCATION?",
  "i guess.",
  "i try.",
  "can't we go to mcdonald's first?",
  "not, if you don ’ t want to.",
  "isn't that awful?",
  "yeah it should be fun to watch.",
  "they have some creative ACADEMIC_DISCIPLINE.",
  "you could have called.",
  "i would if i could upload it to a PRODUCT and it could make me immortal.",
  "he used to play for SPORT_TEAM.",
  "when will it arrive?",
  "i do",
  "interesting indeed.",
  "i saw the first 3 WORK_OF_ART.",
  "that ’ s absurd.",
  "i don't believe the PRODUCT will ever burn down.",
  "with a rotary PRODUCT.",
  "yes they dragged one of the ORG feet first once to vote",
  "thats nutty.",
  "whatever you prefer.",
  "yes, if you think it will help.",
  "no i don't know why.",
  "how's that.",
  "i do but have not seen it.",
  "he created a PRODUCT he didn't fully understand.",
  "i wouldn't think that he would be a good WORK_OF_ART.",
  "i won't.",
  "that is nice.",
  "i did like that.",
  "yes i thought so too.",
  "my PRODUCT has more.",
  "and look at them now.",
  "no i did no know that.",
  "as opposed to short and shallow?",
  "i wonder about ACADEMIC_DISCIPLINE too.",
  "that would have changed the WORK_OF_ART completely!",
  "youre right!",
  "ok, we will.",
  "i didn't think of that.",
  "yeah that is sad and i do not see it stopping at all actually",
  "that is pretty impressive.",
  "oh, i see, but what's it used for?",
  "that is very fitting.",
  "i wonder who thought to try.",
  "what is my OCCUPATION testing me for?",
  "yeah i am exactly the same.",
  "yes they own 86% pf the LOCATION",
  "well, it pays off for her.",
  "yes and he was strangely not even mentioned at all",
  "i don't even know.",
  "it's good you remember that.",
  "gorgeous!",
  "wow that's intense then.",
  "i couldn't agree more!",
  "what ACADEMIC_DISCIPLINE?",
  "i do listen to MUSIC_GENRE and enjoy it as well.",
  "i know i had one.",
  "that's true.specially since it is so popular among kids and all you have to do is claim that you are 13 to use it.",
  "yeah that seems excessive.",
  "i highly recommend you quit soon.",
  "when did they rest?",
  "i read that somewhere!",
  "i find that very hard to believe.",
  "she's pretty good.",
  "i can't say i watch much tv.",
  "hmm i am not sure about that.",
  "wow we have reached that far now.",
  "i would also like to check out these WORK_OF_ART.",

  "that is truly amazing!",
  "sounds nice.",
  "thats pretty neat!",
  "i think that didnt work our.",
  "just hang on there a sec.",
  "that is really hard to believe.",
  "oh, i'm sorry i forgot all about it.",
  "he was so dominate with it.",
  "there are.",
  "512.",
  "yeah i agree it is ironic indeed.",
  "i'm sorry it took so long.",
  "i'm sorry, i can't.",
  "i dont think they do.",
  "let ’ s go check it out again!",
  "i do love PRODUCT too.",
  "the OCCUPATION are not the most important.",
  "that's hard to believe with how popular they were!",
  "it was great chatting with you too!",
  "i do to.",
  "is this to stay or to go?",
  "i wouldn't want to try out running any ANIMAL living or extinct.",
  "that is pretty amazing.",
  "i think there is one in LOCATION.",
  "no, it's a semimonthly.",
  "it'd be really interesting to just read it.",
  "i would even settle for $1m!",
  "and may i have two more PRODUCT, please?",
  "yet.",
  "well it means that they have everything from a to z",
  "i ’ m awesome.",
  "very good, we'll take them all.",

  "and that's fine.",
  "oh. sorry.",
  "i do like TYPE_OF_SPORT when i can watch.",
  "i haven't really listened to much but it seems quite interesting.",
  "it's always hot in june, july and august.",
  "LOCATION account for 80% of it.",
  "reebok!",
  "is it convenient and cheap?",
  "that is kind of unfair.",
  "they have a new PRODUCT.",
  "that was when there were rotary PRODUCT.",
  "that's awesome that he did that.",
  "ok, i'll give it a go.",
  "very surprised!",
  "i dont currently have one either.",
  "it's ok now.",
  "i honestly don't know that.",
  "i am NATION.",
  "i root for the a's.",
  "i hope he appreciates that and maybe donates some of it to ORG...",
  "indeed it was",
  "tell me what you want to eat.",
  "yes they are comfortable.",
  "that's quite low!",
  "true to that.",
  "well, i have been thinking about it.",
  "you're quite funny.",
  "i don't know if they're still banned.",
  "yeah it's good they do.",
  "looks like a lucky EVENT for everyone.",
  "sorry, i think i'il sit out the next EVENT.",
  "im not sure about clicking PRODUCT being what is addictive.",
  "i like TYPE_OF_SPORT more.",

  "that i've heard about.",
  "yes, that sounds great.",
  "i was just made aware of that recently.",
  "not much make up.",
  "i was actually just thinking that would be cool to try out.",
  "it's all in my PRODUCT i'm reading.",
  "i've been invited over to a friend's.",
  "that mike!",
  "i will try my best.",
  "i know PERSON had them installed",
  "that was interesting - i did not know that.",
  "that is also interesting.",
  "instead of walking.you can take this PRODUCT to get you there faster.",
  "he must be really talented.",
  "i don't think i see the WORK_OF_ART between those two.",
  "i agree that's really scary!",
  "so what do you usually search on PRODUCT?",
  "that's a little less than i expected.",
  "wonder what they call TYPE_OF_SPORT?",
  "i know where the c FAC is.",
  "i think he is from LOCATION ?",
  "i am shocked myself.",
  "if it doesnt spin.",
  "i would just give up...",
  "don't laugh that might be coming next.",
  "nice talking.",
  "i don't know but i'd read them too.",
  "oh interesting.",
  "you would think but that's not what they pay me for.",
  "that is what i thought too.",
  "yeah he sure was talented",
  "i'll be studying.",
  "yep i agree that's crazy!",
  "everything in this PRODUCT seems expensive.",
  "is it a used one?",
  "yeah now that was pretty cool they did that back in WORK_OF_ART right?",
  "sure, would you like to see them?",
  "they were pleasantly surprised.",
  "well, i am really surprised.",
  "it was a pretty good EVENT.",
  "yes, i've applied to four LOCATION and have been accepted into all of them.",
  "yeah.  because i was assuming he died.",
  "and all the \"ORG\" that show up with it.",
  "pretty well, i guess.",
  "no.you don't have to pay duty on personal belongings.",
  "yeah i think they were called like that",
  "it sounds reasonable.",
  "it's a non-renewable LOCATION.",
  "i'd like to check that out.",
  "they did!",
  "neither do i. honestly i didnt even know they still offered that.",
  "we're only available at 3",
  "although sometimes i do think.",
  "i wonder what that PRODUCT is like.",
  "it's funny how far we've come since the PRODUCT was invented in 1886",
  "i have gotten lost using PRODUCT.",
  "i like to read more than watch tv.",
  "quite possible.",
  "why should i do that?",
  "i might have to google that later.",
  "that's it.",
  "you can also play PRODUCT on it if you hook it up to your tv.",
  "i bet its PRODUCT that that are sexually suggestive.",
  "i have heard that",
  "i guess i just keep it to TYPE_OF_SPORT mostly.",
  "yeah i do not know anything about her.",
  "1941 actually.",
  "is that your new PRODUCT?",
  "so do you like reading?",
  "that'll do it.",
  "i play the PRODUCT.",
  "glad to hear that you are well.",
  "no that's interesting!",
  "yeah, that's pretty hard for me.",
  "i heard it was more comfortable for them while they played.",
  "i think i'll look into it.",
  "no i only heard it in LANGUAGE!",
  "yeah and in TYPE_OF_SPORT .",
  "yes i had heard that.",
  "neither am i. although i also do occasionally watch it.",
  "i sure hope so!",
  "oh, i prefer it loose",
  "i want to look it up and find out!",
  "not really.",
  "it would be terrifying.",
  "ok.just wait where you are.",
  "indeed or maybe we could finanly have a WORK_OF_ART?",
  "i read about it too.",
  "i know that PERSON isn't among them.",
  "yes i guess not enough tackling or hitting.",
  "shooting OCCUPATION.",
  "i think that is much needed.",
  "that's kind of neat!",
  "i doo not know why but i think BUSINESS did it.",
  "i wonder if those WORK_OF_ART will ever be added to.",
  "yeah that sounds about right",
  "i am very interested.",
  "i've never heard of that before.",
  "i have BUSINESS as well.",
  "but it's saturday!!",
  "i imagine it was pretty tiring for everyone.",
  "i need to remit £ 500 to LOCATION.",
  "okay, but what do i have to do to prepare it?",
  "i am not the guilty POLITICAL_PARTY",
  "oh, just FOOD please.",
  "most states 39 of the 50!",
  "nor.",
  "you'd better.",
  "i'm not sure which WORK_OF_ART she played.",
  "yes. winning is always more fun!",

  "i think i have seen it!",
  "yeah he was great.",
  "in february 2015.",
  "yeah i dont really know what to think about LOCATION.",
  "it's PRODUCT.",
  "weren't they originally called just the ORG?",
  "i really wonder how they managed to do that.",
  "i can think of worse OCCUPATION to be stuck with.",
  "either too stressful of they become disillusioned.",
  "PRODUCT are difficult to travel with.",
  "i love rock!",
  "okay.nice do you like TYPE_OF_SPORT?",
  "i'll take 4,500 rib, please.",
  "what would you do if you were me?",
  "that is pretty cool as well.",
  "yeah that was interesting as well.",
  "personally i wouldn't believe almost anything we know about PERSON.",
  "probably they do not.",
  "wow... can you imagine being comfortable enough to reject $10 million ?",
  "no they would not.",
  "who is that.",
  "which PRODUCT should i take then?",
  "no i didn't even know they existed.",
  "i wonder if it is still available on PRODUCT?",
  "i think that might make it harder for some ORG to take him seriously.",
  "hopefully you aren't talking while you're dead.",
  "according to PERSON.",
  "no but that is hilarious.",
  "thats neat!",
  "i think i have heard about that before.",
  "i didn't mean to go deep.",
  "ive heard of it.",
  "they're also one of the richest ORG.",
  "why is that necessary?",
  "that was super nice of him.",
  "yes they actually did that up until 1998!",
  "you can just go to work after you vote.",
  "that must be nice.",
  "i bet you are right.",
  "yeah that was nice to accommodate them.",
  "it's stupid.",
  "that is pretty nuts.",
  "what made you transfer?",
  "what are you doing for it?",
  "just what?",
  "ya i wondered that too.",
  "thank you, i will.",
  "yeah i have read that about PERSON before",
  "the PRODUCT came around in 1908",
  "lol yes!",
  "how's her PRODUCT?",
  "i think you're right about that.",
  "i believe it was PERSON to be honest.",
  "right and who keeps playing after that?",
  "sounds good you too.",
  "i do enjoy TYPE_OF_SPORT also!",
  "$ 200 altogether.",
  "well if it is educational for them then that is good.",
  "i don't know what he graduated in.",
  "yes..you are right.",
  "will you need all of them right away or can some wait?",
  "i think that's probably a LAW that was meant to be broken.",
  "i ’ d be glad to.",
  "i haven't",
  "i sometimes do.",
  "yes it can be deceiving but it helps.",
  "i didnt.",
  "it is WORK_OF_ART-powered.",
  "i though he was fun.",
  "ok.now how can i help, hon?",
  "BUSINESS is nuts!",
  "id?",
  "why don't you apply?",
  "you'd be surprised!",
  "yeah they sure did.",
  "i can't imagine breathing when i'm 100.",
  "do you watch BUSINESS?",
  "i've never thought about it.",
  "which PRODUCT do you prefer?",
  "he sure has.",
  "i have not heard of him doing that but you never know.",
  "enough for a BUSINESS to still broadcast it.",
  "yep it's completely different now.",
  "so you are interested in our BUSINESS.",
  "i have signed up for the PRODUCT.",
  "i don't mind them and kind of like it.",
  "it depends which PRODUCT.",
  "i don't know too much about that.",
  "i think all you mentioned are great.",
  "ok, please have me arrange one.",
  "i am sorry, but i think i ordered FOOD.",
  "i guess that is not that important.",
  "yes he was very smart.",
  "would you like anything to drink?",
  "i bet that was staged.",
  "are TYPE_OF_SPORT worth anything?",
  "i was thinking a PRODUCT.",
  "i am on a FOOD.",
  "yeah, that's great.",
  "who's playing?",
  "that is so pitifully sad.",
  "what can i do for you?",
  "i listen to them sometimes .",
  "yeah you're right",
  "it is hilarious considering now we have the opposite WORK_OF_ART.",
  "i would like to reschedule.",
  "i am!",
  "oh, did he?",
  "and WORK_OF_ART is only going to grow.",
  "good for them.",
  "i get that.",
  "i don't intend to but so much of what i do is through the PRODUCT now.",
  "i see!",
  "yes that is kind of neat.",
  "yeah those OCCUPATION were rich as well.",
  "i like it more as well.",
  "i wonder how much it made?",
  "ok, as i expected.",
  "ya i need to see a WORK_OF_ART.",
  "no.  they started in vaudeville",
  "ok, we will make it ready for you.",
  "i haven't read much of that.",
  "well, fish it will be then.",
  "that does seem strange.",
  "i dont remember him much.",
  "you can yell at them.",
  "i used to love WORK_OF_ART.",
  "i don't really watch it or BUSINESS.",
  "and these two?",
  "im not sure if i do either lol.",
  "ah ok. sounds interesting.",
  "i bet they regret not pulling it.",
  "i pretty sure very little.",
  "they are poplar PRODUCT.",
  "like something out of the WORK_OF_ART?  yeah.",
  "i found that so odd.",
  "yes thank you you too!",
  "no, do you want to go and do something?",
  "that is really nice and so great!",
  "sure, we can.",
  "i would have voted for that.",
  "everything is fast-paced in LOCATION.",
  "i had to look it up but it's true.",
  "i much prefer a hard PRODUCT.",
  "he can play the PRODUCT.",
  "that is, your ORG.",
  "i think i might've bumped into her before.",
  "do they use PRODUCT over there?",
  "i think i have heard that before.",
  "what is blutube?",
  "it's not so long really.",
  "surely it will be.",
  "i just found out.",
  "did you ever play on the PRODUCT?",
  "which is why i'm single....",
  "william.",
  "yeah some PRODUCT here and there.",
  "i highly doubt it.",
  "that was a very generous LAW.",
  "why did you think ANIMAL were colorblind?",
  "what's wrong with it?",
  "but, you were born and raised in LOCATION!",
  "i'll have to look it up and find it.",
  "that's what i was thinking!",
  "no but that certainly is commendable of them.",
  "yeah.. then he lost it",
  "well, it's more like she kept me busy...",
  "one isn ’ t necessarily better than the other.",
  "but it wasn ’ t just you who was involved, right?",
  "i hear that they can be very strong.",
  "yep he was deaf.",
  "that's interseting.",
  "i guess it would then.",
  "i guess that ’ s out.",
  "i like TYPE_OF_SPORT.",
  "i never heard of him actually.",
  "only 54 PRODUCT.",
  "i haven't read it.",
  "they are relaxing to stare at.",
  "would you like it on the LOCATION, sir?",
  "PRODUCT",
  "it was so terrible.",
  "that would be interesting.",
  "did they find that by themselves or they were told how to do it ?",
  "i think it just shows how outdated some of our military PRODUCT is.",
  "i havent heard of him.",
  "even LOCATION is illegal!",
  "yeah i think i would agree.",
  "no, you needn ’ t do that.",
  "could you please try?",
  "some are pretty interesting.",
  "wasn't it discontinued in 2003?",
  "yes, but i'll bet she won't again.",
  "i know that is crazy.",
  "i ’ m sure.",
  "i read about that recently.",
  "i like all of that.",
  "not really, to be honest.",
  "why would the OCCUPATION lie?",
  "that seems pretty offensive.",
  "so am i.",
  "yes, i'll work on it.",
  "well.. we're not sure yet, probably in st.albans.",
  "sure, let's go to LOCATION.",
  "i hope they win.",
  "i play them every now and then.",
  "ya she went just for a EVENT she likes to travel!",
  "$ 6.",
  "is he getting better now?",
  "not to mention all they can make from FOOD.",
  "are you sure that's high enough?",
  "super expensive!",
  "i'm sure it is.",
  "well, i hope that i do well.",
  "let's get frozen FOOD.",
  "do you play PRODUCT?",
  "dont know",
  "that ’ s right.",
  "i think that we are so lucky to have ANIMAL.",
  "i realize that now.",
  "that's acceptable.",
  "wow...very interesting PRODUCT.",
  "it will be interesting indeed.",
  "no.  i unfortunately do not keep up with TYPE_OF_SPORT much.",
  "they are a classic ORG from 70s.",
  "ya i do wonder that.",
  "but that's better than keeping everything to yourself.",
  "nothing right now.",
  "what would you do without me?",
  "i ’ m not too worried about it.",
  "no i don't get it either.",
  "well thats not good for PERSON.",
  "well, why don't you go and look down there?",
  "it has gotten rougher.",
  "i'm not sure...that's terrible!",
  "i know i would think there would be more.",
  "i wonder what that would sound like if it were translated.",
  "i know of him.",
  "yes. PRODUCT.",
  "did you know theres only one left handed OCCUPATION?",
  "what was she going to LOCATION for?",
  "i had heard him say that before.",
  "how much did you want to spend?",
  "i wasn't done talking to you.",
  "no what's that?",
  "nearly everything.",
  "oh no.  never heard of that.",
  "i hear they have very nice PRODUCT.",
  "i have voted since i turned 18.",
  "i agree with you!",
  "thats very considerate in LOCATION.",
  "i would not have done that.",
  "dream on!",
  "i don't know when they won.",
  "that would be awesome right now",
  "never ridden a ANIMAL.",
  "we are done talking.",
  "oddly enough.",
  "yes. must have been non stop too!",
  "i have not tried that.",
  "i still have to watch that one myself.",
  "where will you be going?",
  "i didn't do that well either.",
  "i don't know if i could handle that to be honest.",
  "i see that.",
  "i wonder what they teach in that LOCATION.",
  "yeah it seems they are bringing in the ORG who have done it all before.",
  "it has been.",
  "thats pretty cool!!!",
  "they must have been really something.",
  "and what happened?",
  "dance?",
  "in LOCATION?",
  "but let me tell you, you're doing just fine.",
  "is there anything interesting?",
  "can i help you get ready?",
  "i don ’ t understand.",
  "a OCCUPATION he is not",
  "they are not feeling satisfied?",
  "ok... why are they doing that ?",
  "i'm not sure that is true.",
  "ok.please step in.",
  "i liked 90's and earlier rap more.",
  "i hope that gets settled soon.",
  "i'm sorry, but june 30 is quite soon.",
  "yes, very.",
  "what was you g.p.a?",
  "i watch every so often.",
  "well, he's young, tall and thin.",
  "if you think of it it was a great PRODUCT.",
  "apparently they can also play.",
  "what is wrong with you?",
  "i'd most definitely lose.",
  "yeah that would have been.",
  "that is very cool!",
  "did you tell him?",
  "that's right, i have to work hard.",
  "that is strange the un would do that.",
  "all cleaned up.",
  "i think they are worried about cybersquatting.",
  "apparently they got suspended.",
  "the elvis band?",
  "no, but we went to the FAC.",
  "i think he is allergic to them.",
  "and merry christmas!",
  "interesting!",
  "and the WORK_OF_ART.",
  "i am not sure about that but that would be nice.",
  "thank you for the EVENT.",
  "i dont know that NATION would ever want to go there.",
  "it is popular.",
  "i'm surprised it's as much as that.",
  "4434 1234 5678 9902?",
  "im pretty sure she is.",
  "yes, a little.",
  "well NATION can be quite tall and strong.",
  "ok...we'll talk about TYPE_OF_SPORT next then.",
  "yes it sounds very conservative.",
  "anyway...",
  "that's ironic.",
  "no, i have not.",
  "when are they going to have the EVENT?",
  "ha. would have never have guessed.",
  "aw that is actually really sweet.",
  "his ORG will be pleased to hear that.",
  "i heard it was $309.",
  "let me get $ 150 back.",
  "oh, they were lovely.",
  "yes, i think that's it.",
  "i grew up with BUSINESS.",
  "it's me.",
  "it could be in 1800.",

  "has that always existed?",
  "wilson.",
  "but i don't like playing the PRODUCT.",
  "yeah but that was because they rewrote it verbatim.",

  "i promise i'll pay you back as soon as we get home.",
  "where is my favorite white FOOD?",
  "i think it's rampant everywhere!",
  "yeah i don't think that would work very well.",
  "good, if you agree we'll draft the LAW right away and sign it then.",
  "did she ever teach you to read PRODUCT?",
  "that's not very much.",
  "this is very true.",
  "no i cannot say that i do.",
  "you could run locally.",

  "i think they do understand it!",
  "that is interesting to me.",
  "what's on?",
  "that's kind of scary to know.",
  "it fits me exactly.",
  "it depends on the PRODUCT!",
  "i listen to the PRODUCT only when i am riding and boring.",
  "well at least you wear PRODUCT.",
  "and is that legal or not ?",
  "no, outside FOOD is not permitted.",
  "do you listen to the PRODUCT any more or are you like me and have gone digital for everything?",
  "it would have been great to have invested in the BUSINESS much earlier!",
  "i would have thought so too.",
  "why do you think that is?",
  "yeah some of them.",
  "you'll get used to it.",
  "that is cool...",
  "oh, how did you deal with it?",
  "yes -- a ANIMAL.",

  "well, you see.",
  "yes i'm not sure",
  "that's okay,",
  "did you know PRODUCT used to be wooden?",

  "i think they were cheeky for doing so.",
  "but i feel better.",
  "sometimes, the narrow-minded ORG make me frustrated.",
  "if i had a PRODUCT that would be cool.",
  "i agree - that would be crazy.",
  "and that was not the only one!",
  "and they are right to be afraid.",
  "do you also use PRODUCT?",
  "i think that as well.",
  "sure, they do.",
  "that is so much.",
  "i think that might be because nobody votes.",
  "ok,",
  "i'm getting hungry.",
  "on the LOCATION.",
  "well not entirely.",
  "so they have been around for a while.",
  "actually he (PERSON) was really good",
  "i don't unfortunately.",
  "that's new to me also.",
  "i don't honestly know any of his MUSIC_GENRE.",
  "but they wouldn't lay you off!",
  "how would you like your FOOD?",
  "yeah not sure either.",
  "i'll bet!",
  "i don't have tv.",
  "it really surprises me that they are among the richest OCCUPATION.",

  "i saw that one.",
  "yeah i bet they do.",
  "no i didn't know that either!",
  "what do you think about these PRODUCT?",

  "yes, you did.",
  "i'm very sorry about this.",
  "it might be too hot for me.",
  "i do now.",
  "we'll have to PRODUCT that later too.",

  "that is not very much at all.",
  "that would be so awesome.",

  "wow yeah that would be interesting to listen to.",
  "now that is hard to believe!",
  "i like him yes.",
  "it is hard to know.",
  "the PRODUCT is universal.",
  "i'm thinking you haven't heard much more than whats on the PRODUCT then",
  "who do you think will be elected?",
  "i've read it and found it interesting.",
  "like samuel l. jackson does?",
  "at least it still requires PRODUCT.",
  "ah. wasn't his NORP that prevented him from doing them?",
  "funded by.",
  "kind of strange.",
  "what's that?",
  "oh for sure it was.",
  "have you talked to him?",
  "i don't really know.",
  "ok.let ’ s invite all their little ORG to come and celebrate.",
  ":) :)",
  "i am sure that WORK_OF_ART was filed.",
  "that's very impressive for sure.",
  "he must be really good.",
  "that is interesting how they can feed off each other like that.",
  "who is the best active qb?",
  "i'm afraid he doesn't.",
  "i have heard about it while in LOCATION.",
  "i figure that is an excellent WORK_OF_ART!",
  "yes, my LAW was accepted last friday.",
  "aren't you happy now?",
  "for both.",
  "was he unhappy with you not attending the EVENT?",
  "i would say so!!",
  "i also want to check that out!",
  "they may have thought they won the EVENT.",
  "seems like it happened around from 2000 to around 2010.",
  "i think he is a nice OCCUPATION too everytime i watch him.",
  "that is surprising indeed.",
  "when are you going to tell her that WORK_OF_ART doesn't exist?",
  "small yet influential?",
  "i don't know i've never seen it.",
  "maybe TYPE_OF_SPORT too.",
  "you should've called in sick!",
  "okay i'll go with that.",
  "he seems to stay busy.",
  "probably because its a LOCATION i assume and they go through so much.",
  "i wonder how he will do compared to mj.",
  "i am a WORK_OF_ART.",
  "i help out at the children ’ s hospital.",
  "yes, they ’ re very fashionable, you see.",
  "sure, who am i bidding against?",
  "what ’ s that building opposite us?",
  "it was 2001",
  "the cowboys?",
  "i locked it when i left though.",

  "i wonder if he keeps himself from trying one just to say he never had one.",
  "i prefer WORK_OF_ART too.",
  "there aren't",
  "i had read that.",
  "that is very cool.",
  "they were really successful.",
  "might watch some more of it i guess.",
  "a soft PRODUCT or hard one?",
  "i hope it will happen.",
  "oh wow... was TYPE_OF_SPORT that popular in the 60's ?",
  "don't cut into them until you can feel that they're soft on the LOCATION.",
  "FOOD is really bad for you.",
  "thats too bad",
  "i don't know who would win.",
  "wow how is that even possible?",
  "i want to keep both of them, if that's possible.",
  "i wonder where he rode it from!",
  "that would be very cool to visit.",
  "and they can learn over 1000 LANGUAGE.",
  "i think they play wonderful MUSIC_GENRE.",
  "i don't think i have.",
  "yes, that's often true.",
  "these here are all WORK_OF_ART.",
  "i really don't know what to buy.",
  "they need to be at the FAC!",

  "i've heard of it never watched it though.",
  "as always.",
  "i have had an BUSINESS since it started.",

  "i have seen that...cool.",
  "i sure do.",
  "it could have.",
  "i have not seen it yet.",
  "not clear to me either.",
  "i guess they were afraid somebody would attack them ?",
  "why was LOCATION well known?",
  "that is definitely interesting.",
  "i agree with your NORP.",
  "i would recommend it, yes.",
  "perhaps you should excercise more.",
  "um... let me see now, is it 18 or 19, i can never remember...",
  "even if they are distantly related.",
  "that we are!!!",
  "i won't even speculate!",

  "did the OCCUPATION hire her?",
  "no didnt know about that.",
  "no what was it?",

  "i'll have to look more into that.",
  "how about these?",
  "yes i totally agree with you.",
  "ok.do you have anything to declare?",
  "it says he was born january 8.",
  "i don't know if i would put anything past them based on everything we have come to learn about him and his NORP!",
  "he was really good.",
  "ya he is.",
  "i'll go.",
  "i try to watch the SPORTS_EVENT.",
  "that is interesting i always wondered that.",
  "i never used it.",
  "i could't be on tv.",
  "that sounds impossible.",
  "that's neat that it was made out PRODUCT!",
  "why did you say so?",
  "i cant say that i do.",
  "i would pay to see that!",
  "i didn;t know that.",
  "ok.i'll be free from nine to eleven.",
  "how late can we stay out?",
  "oh his?",

  "yes it was the same swedish programmer that de\nPRODUCT utorrent",
  "that is a good back up.",
  "i have not heard.",
  "playing at SPORTS_VENUE didn't deter them.",
  "oh nice how was it?",
  "oh, are you?",
  "that would never fly in the us.",
  "PRODUCT!",
  "maybe that does.",
  "i do!.",
  "did you know that she used to be a POLITICAL_PARTY?",
  "let's just say i'll have it easy...",
  "that was pretty skilled of them to be able to do that!",
  "PRODUCT is good.",
  "it was good chatting with you",
  "i think he will come back at 3 p. m. do you want to call later?",
  "is it?",
  "that's what i'm thinking.",
  "i can't say that i do no.",
  "i have to check it out.",
  "if he/she was in elementary LOCATION in the us before 1963.",
  "when there is a PRODUCT available, i will call you.",
  "i do!",
  "BUSINESS was happy to pay.",
  "well, let me see.",
  "it's where they have spirited.",

  "as popular as it seems.",
  "i do like ACADEMIC_DISCIPLINE.",
  "you could try the FOOD.",
  "um, me?",
  "i'm not sure how it works either.",
  "once a PRODUCT is available, i will let you know.",
  "you have to stand behind them that's for sure.",
  "oh, yeah,",

  "yeah that is pretty smart.",
  "that ’ s should be fun.",
  "i don't have that much to pay to go!",
  "he owns the SPORT_TEAM.",
  "not me.",
  "your ORG would be happy if they knew that.",
  "yes they have a LAW to do that for those that run away from voting",
  "they must have.",
  "PERSON as in the daily show?",
  "that sounds right.",
  "it's 1446 LOCATION.",
  "i promise i'll go to sleep soon.",
  "actually its because the OCCUPATION is able to play if he needs to.",
  "who is your favorite BUSINESS qb?",
  "im not so sure i agree with that.",
  "i imagine it would be.",
  "i had heard that somewhere.",
  "i wasn't aware.",

  "yes it is so sexist and it really need to go if you ask me",
  "how long will i wait for?",
  "he seems like a great OCCUPATION.",
  "it was good speaking to you.",
  "can i get it PRODUCT-free?",
  "i'm on the LOCATION.",
  "it's on the 2nd FAC.",
  "it's unfair.",
  "she even stayed at a different BUSINESS.",
  "i often shop online at BUSINESS.",
  "they are definitely interesting.",
  "i really admire you for that.",
  "it's ironic that the EVENT was anything but efficient.",
  "...and that's how it should be !",
  "i was just thinking that.",
  "i don't understand that one either.",
  "i did not!",
  "even cooler.",
  "it is near the LOCATION.",
  "i play PRODUCT.",

  "thats really good of them!",
  "that would be.",
  "very cool to learn.",
  "have you heard of PERSON.",
  "yes i do too.",
  "i think thats really admirable.",
  "when will we know if they accept the LAW?",
  "the 4th highest OCCUPATION!",
  "i wish someone would sponsor me with what i'm doing!",
  "i assume they are involved pretty deeply.",
  "did the ORG find out why he flew into the u.s.?",
  "i would love to go to that BUSINESS myself.",
  "i dont know him.",
  "can you go there with me?",
  "but she doesn't want to be seen to doing something totally wrong.",
  "wow, not long.",
  "what were you screaming at me for?",
  "yeah he really did not want to have anything to do with the POLITICAL_PARTY",
  "i wasn ’ t serious, because PERSON got elected.",
  "no i didn't know about that either.",
  "i think it was paul d. hubbard?",

  "i ’ m so proud of you.",
  "i really didn't mean to run it.",
  "well, yeah,",
  "i once read that.",
  "if you know somebody at the BUSINESS, ask them.",

  "that's not nice.",
  "i have not seen WORK_OF_ART.",
  "goodness me!",
  "it is pretty tough for sure.",
  "thats NORP.",
  "ya that is important i guess.",
  "you can take me to the BUSINESS if you want to.",
  "i don't know how it works but it's so cool!",
  "no, we don't, especially the old ORG.",
  "$ 20.",
  "ok, please.",
  "that's very generous of you.",
  "impressive.",
  "maybe it got passed down to his ORG.",
  "oh that's good to know.",
  "jupiter's moon.",
  "look, i am playing the PRODUCT for you.",
  "that sounds good!",
  "with the current political WORK_OF_ART.",
  "i would have fallen asleep watching that.",
  "you're just jealous.",
  "the PRODUCT are comparatively light, and therefore easy to handle.",
  "how do i use the PRODUCT?",
  "i've never been but i surely want to go there someday!",
  "i actually preferred PRODUCT.",
  "that is certainly true.",
  "how much do you have?",
  "i use PRODUCT weekly.",
  "well, i'm not quite ready.",
  "to each his own.",
  "i also heard something else funny.",
  "now that i agree with.",

  "ok.here are your WORK_OF_ART.",
  "is a white PRODUCT ok?",
  "can ’ t you just tell me now?",
  "yeah i guess it did.",
  "that is pretty good though.",
  "i'll take some, too.",
  "it is hard to learn.",
  "they need those in LOCATION too.",
  "surely, i'll have one made for you.",
  "how long has the PRODUCT been leaking?",
  "then i don't think they deserve to be fired.",
  "oh, i'm afraid we've sold out of those.",
  "oh wow i'm surprised.",
  "no, i couldn't care less!",
  "i do not see the WORK_OF_ART either.",
  "i find it interesting how they name the SPORT_TEAM.",
  "i have seen some of those.",
  "yes... quite pretty.",
  "is that better now?",
  "i always thought that too.",
  "let's see...",
  "i think she will.",
  "then i might as well have it done now.",
  "no i didn't know that is how they do that.",
  "supposedly.",
  "i know some PRODUCT like that is white but we see it as yellow.",
  "not that much into TYPE_OF_SPORT.",
  "interesting....i didn't know that either.",
  "yes, he said it would be batter for me and for the whole ORG.",
  "bummer.",
  "not so many really.",
  "is there anything i can do for you?",
  "um... i have to confess, i haven't given it much thought.",
  "i heard that and it sounds nuts.",
  "wow. sounds impressive!",
  "he really is great at everything.",
  "i never knew that... that is crazy!",
  "not at all i think that would be devastating for our LOCATION honestly.",
  "what else can we do to protect the LOCATION?",
  "i like a good OCCUPATION and a smart one.",
  "what are you being charged with?",
  "i heard something about him writing about WORK_OF_ART.",
  "i majored in ACADEMIC_DISCIPLINE.",
  "i knew that you would agree.",
  "not really... never thought about it",
  "oh that sounds pretty awesome",
  "that's all, thank you.",
  "those used to be fun to go to when i was younger.",
  "i also listen when i exercise.",
  "yes all of that while he was in OCCUPATION.",
  "i'll take the PRODUCT.",
  "ya well i would love it personally.",
  "i think what made it scary was how young he was.",
  "nope. never heard that.",
  "you add PRODUCT to that.",
  "yeah i could see them being popular.",
  "yes, and if i stay with you, we will have to walk back home to LOCATION.",
  "leave it to BUSINESS",
  "i really don't know much about the LOCATION.",
  "right too funny!",
  "i agree and thats relaxing.",
  "and with only 29% being land-- it's kind of crazy to know that humans live on such a small part of the LOCATION's surface.",
  "i was unaware of that as well.",
  "how did you find him at last?",
  "that would be impressive to go to.",
  "yeah he is great but as good as he is.",
  "do you mind if we switch over?",
  "could you point me toward the dishwashing PRODUCT?",
  "it most definitely is!",
  "i haven't watched it in awhile.",
  "i do not know about it too.",
  "sounds not good.",
  "that is so strange and it was actually until very recently 1993",
  "i'm sure it was much.",
  "i could agree with you about that.",
  "do you know what building that it's in?",
  "12",
  "i think i'm too clumsy.",
  "what is bothering you?",
  "that should work.",
  "that's because you did well.",
  "i can't think of anything.",
  "hopefully they continue to improve.",
  "adios",
  "ha to funny!",
  "i think that is short sighted.",
  "sounds pretty comical...",
  "it is shocking.",
  "they spend more on PRODUCT than bandwidth.",
  "see, i helped you out.",
  "that sure does.",
  "yeah and i actually wonder how they control that",
  "please do that.",
  "how long will it take to get them dry?",
  "i have not",
  "that would be very.",
  "yeah that would be quite a WORK_OF_ART as well!",
  "i wonder that myself.",
  "wait!",
  "didnt know that",
  "it tastes good.",
  "i know, you're absolutely right.",
  "good to know",
  "it is over 100 billion now",
  "that's probably the best.",
  "why dont we actively try to harness it?",
  "they are a strong SPORT_TEAM.",
  "i use to wonder about that?",
  "i agree that it got a little tiresome.",
  "what about the PRODUCT?",
  "i think i'll drop out now.",
  "you know that i care for you.",
  "that's a good LOCATION.",
  "do you have a PRODUCT?",
  "i would like to see that!",
  "i would imagine they have a EVENT for that as well.",
  "no i haven't either.",
  "yes he definitely is.",
  "i think PRODUCT was blue too.",
  "tv has expanded so much since the '70's!",
  "i mean very short.",
  "well i can't comment on that as i don't really remember what he looks like.",
  "yeah i bet they are.",
  "that was nice of him.",
  "she is amazing.",
  ":) i'm not a trusted source yet!",
  "i wonder how that would work.",
  "can we just sit wherever we want?",
  "i guess that is why lightening PRODUCT are still white when they are just as hot or hotter.",
  "that's unfortunate.",
  "you know though.",
  "did you promise him?",
  "could you please reserve it for me?",
  "it has definitely gone way too far.",
  "really, because spicy FOOD is my favorite.",
  "well, do what you like.",
  "you can buy them either ripe or unripe.",
  "you are correct :)",
  "what did you end up getting?",
  "do you let me know where to get off?",
  "some were.",
  "i signed up for it online.",
  "i bet he could.",
  "the BUSINESS said they should be fine.",
  "ya i'll never be able to see it all.",
  "yeah that is very unique.",
  "i thought that was really funny as well.",
  "i am not interested but i know there is a free PRODUCT for them.",
  "it certainly was.",
  "ok, well, i'm going to LOCATION.",
  "eight seasons?",
  "when should i take them?",
  "i guess it is better to be prepared.",
  "what does that even mean.",
  "yes, they're in... let me think...",
  "i am not sure what all the us would be able to do in LOCATION.",
  "yep i remember that.",
  "ok.where?",
  "you know what's really crazy.",
  "i want to live abroad and learn to speak a different LANGUAGE.",
  "i know i rarely do.",
  "that's really impressive!",
  "i just as soon buy a new PRODUCT.",
  "they probably are.",
  "mmm...",
  "you can wear that pretty red PRODUCT.",
  "how worrisome.",
  "definitely not.",
  "do you mind washing my PRODUCT?",
  "tell us how.",
  "i have heard that the FOOD is longer lasting.",
  "yeah i thank them for that because i use it so much.",
  "which PRODUCT?",
  "but i am still traditional, so i felt weird when she paid for herself.",
  "me, either.",
  "let me take you.",
  "very well, thank you.",
  "that's getting pretty radical.",
  "yes i agree there with you.",
  "maybe they did not trust them.",
  "huh that is more than i knew.",
  "i did know that.",
  "i will have to check that out!",
  "yeah they named a FAC after him.",
  "i have a few myself and want more.",
  "i did hear that.",
  "as long as we ’ re going, you can decide where to go.",
  "i sure wouldn't either.",
  "FOOD isn't good for you.",
  "no, it's too expensive for me.",
  "you can find simplified PRODUCT for the less accomplished.",
  "you ’ re sure we ’ re not forgetting anything?",
  "$ 15.and for a hard one, only $ 6.",
  "i watch both.",
  "couldn't agree more.",
  "yes, and the FOOD was horrible!",
  "indeed it was!",
  "yeah, she's hot.",
  "i think he did win it.",
  "canada!",
  "ok.is this all right?",
  "i think they are born black and brown.",
  "the very first one was added in 1975!",
  "i think either ACADEMIC_DISCIPLINE would be pretty awesome to be honest.",
  "all that's left is a PRODUCT.",
  "what amazes me is that it has 137 million BUSINESS.",
  "do you go to EVENT?",
  "i have, actually.",
  "that's pretty incredible.",
  "yes, that's true.",
  "you needn't worry about it.",
  "oh i heard about that.",
  "i think he was.",
  "i like them too.",
  "they have great PRODUCT to run for that long.",
  "you have been to LOCATION?",
  "i don't remember that WORK_OF_ART but i will have to look into it.",
  "well, it's very expensive and they're usually singing in another LANGUAGE.",
  "no, i mean some of them are not clean enough.",
  "yes they had some quite interesting PRODUCT.",
  "well, i mean.",
  "oh, yeah.",
  "i dont think it would help much.",
  "see all these black LOCATION?",
  "no i didn't see that one.",
  "it's kind of surprising as i figured LOCATION had discontinued it long before 2003!",
  "he must have.",
  "yes i have heard of that.",
  "oh, i am from LOCATION as well.",
  "but i am not that someone.",
  "well they don't allow PRODUCT or anything like that.",
  "it's so cool.",
  "oh my me too.",
  "i love him he is so funny.",
  "i try to understand it!",
  "well i'm not sure but the PRODUCT is constantly changing so it sounds strange to me.",
  "are you feeling any better?",
  "i know how you feel.",
  "yes i think it's interesting.",
  "it very interesting.",
  "don ’ t worry about that.",
  "wow, that would be something to look forward to.",
  "i loved that WORK_OF_ART.",
  "i can understand that!",
  "around seven.",
  "i did see it.",
  "this is a BUSINESS!",
  "oh, you look quite slender and more vivacious.",
  "the same here.",
  "the FOOD wasn't all that exciting.",
  "yeah i guess they were banned by the ORG when they first came out.",
  "15.",
  "could you sign each WORK_OF_ART here for me?",
  "that is really surprising.",
  "wikileaks.",
  "what's that now?",
  "i would love to attend one .",
  "they do but it doesn't seem like we ever hear about them.",
  "this is one of my favorite PRODUCT.",
  "jack sparrow!",
  "and he fought against the LOCATION.",
  "PERSON was cunning.",
  "how obnoxious!",
  "i remember that ORG",
  "i agree, but i would find it difficult to stop using my PRODUCT.",
  "friday sounds good.",
  "well i don't see how anyone can not like ORG!",
  "i might start.",
  "i'm just glad it's over.",
  "i really don't want to go by myself.",
  "did the ORG get him?",
  "exactly what did he do?",
  "they might be secure.",
  "that doesnt seem comfortable.",
  "if i would answer that.",
  "it's not far away, then.",
  "well that's interesting.",
  "no havent watched that one.",
  "oh, they are fine.",
  "that must be sad for him.",
  "oh ok  .well .",
  "well, that's not rare.",
  "did not know that!",
  "can i read it when you're finished?",
  "heard that PRODUCT is great.",
  "i am into both.",
  "i don't think he cared.",
  "they did that back in 2010 right?",
  "he is crazy funny!!",
  "it is definitely a beautiful PRODUCT.",
  "actually it is because they are required by LAW.",
  "but she was in LOCATION!",
  "i will try my best to persuade her to reconsider the LAW.",
  "and then right at the FAC.",
  "i wonder why they call it that?",
  "i have heard of a PRODUCT that does that.",
  "let ’ s go outside and talk.",
  "would agree 100%.",
  "thank you for hiring me.",
  "surely will.",
  "yeah i have seen his WORK_OF_ART.",

  "no i havent seen them.",
  "he seems to be quite the accomplished OCCUPATION.",

  "oh, i'm glad.",
  "ah i have heard that.",
  "that is interesting to know.",
  "i feel like this is their EVENT.",
  "would you change it to a new one?",
  "well, that's true.",
  "i have never played it.",
  "mainly PRODUCT.",
  "ryan coogler?",
  "that's good to know if i ever climb it though!",
  "would be nice.",
  "with the PRODUCT taken out, it might be bigger than it looks.",
  "i have't heard of him either.",
  "i really can't say how long she'll be.",
  "it looks good.",
  "that should happen.",
  "they don't show on the LOCATION anymore.",
  "yeah MUSIC_GENRE can be really fun to listen to.",
  "2 million?",
  "i used to go hunting with my PERSON, that's how.",

  "i wish i could too.",
  "you can always call me if you need anything and i will get it for you.",
  "and they will yell back at you.",
  "sounds good.",
  "sure, a BUSINESS would be fine.",
  "why was it banned?",
  "i don't agree with that.",
  "i would love to visit LOCATION.",
  "yes, but i still think it could be better.",
  "i've absolutely certain.",
  "no, i'm going back to LOCATION to visit.",
  "eek!",
  "do you mean on its LOCATION?",
  "he's probably better than some OCCUPATION we've had.",
  "i don't know who initiated.",
  "i ’ m glad that you like it.",
  "it's so small that i didn't notice it.",
  "i believe it is true.",

  "i agree entirely.",
  "what is the PRODUCT?",
  "yes, i'd love to.",
  "so do i.let ’ s go to other LOCATION to see what they have got, shall we?",

  "that is neat!",
  "it's like this.",
  "well, i ’ m not going to answer it.",
  "we're on the same PRODUCT.",

  "just imagine if it was closer!",
  "well that's admirable.",
  "wild!",
  "i can't think the same.",
  "yes, maybe.",
  "well, it's $ 12.",
  "we like all the WORK_OF_ART.",

  "that's pretty nice.",
  "that was exactly what i was thinking.",
  "what is that about?",
  "yes, most of them think it's good.",
  "they could've bought it for 75 million and now it's worth 104 billion!",
  "and that there's so much we can't possibly know about it.",
  "must have paid pretty good otherwise i don't think they would have done it for that long.",
  "and she didnt die right away.",
  "so much about ACADEMIC_DISCIPLINE i dont know.",
  "everybody's buying them.",

  "i'd be glad to.",
  "i see well enough of ACADEMIC_DISCIPLINE.",
  "i never would have guessed that.",
  "i've been to the SPORTS_VENUE before.",
  "i heard it was because of the ORG.",
  "i used to play",
  "not exactly.",
  "oh, god, please tell me how.",
  "with only 9 OCCUPATION.",
  "that is hard to even comprehend now!",
  "i am...",
  "i would say that you're probably correct.",
  "i didn't realize he was the highest paid OCCUPATION.",
  "how are they doing now?",
  "i was going to ask if you have a PRODUCT.",
  "he sold the FAC twice right?",
  "that is definitely true.",
  "that's completely natural.",
  "probably wouldnt as there are too many different NORP.",
  "later i would say.",
  "it was funny for sure!",
  "oh, i agree.",
  "ya that doesn't surprise me it sounds like something you shouldn't do.",
  "what about going to LOCATION?",
  "i guess he was presidential enough for everyone else",
  "we may not.",
  "i think i'll go and get my FOOD there.",
  "i saw that...it is so wacky.",
  "who hasn't?",
  "you're back already.",
  "i know and that's sad.",
  "i want to see them.",
  "you don't mind, do you?",
  "yeah, but that's what she did.",
  "yeah he is a strange WORK_OF_ART.",
  "it costs less to wash here.",
  "i don't know but it must mean FOOD are detrimental",
  "you're lucky.",
  "i don't listen to the PRODUCT now much.",
  "i think she is a good WORK_OF_ART.",
  "i would think this was the least they could do.",
  "yeah, i never thought we could be good ORG either.",
  "that's for sure!",
  "are you sure you want me to cut it that short?",
  "well those are really popular.",
  "yeah i guess as with anything else when you do it too much",
  "i heard it was because it was a special focusing on women's ACADEMIC_DISCIPLINE",
  "i'm skeptical.",
  "flubber?",
  "i hate when that happens.",
  "it would be fun to watch though.",
  "they would have to be.",
  "that's what they say.",
  "yeah i remember that too.",
  "maybe you should start seeing someone else.",
  "there really isn ’ t anything else to do right now except wait.",
  "am i going to see you there?",
  "i sure have.",
  "yeah pretty impressive.",
  "yes it was 2.263.",
  "r&b.",
  "that is odd!",
  "then maybe you should go to LOCATION.",
  "would you like some FOOD first?",
  "he will have to retire soon.",
  "MUSIC_GENRE is easy to like.",
  "i think they still do.",
  "i ’ m just going to stay at BUSINESS.",
  "ACADEMIC_DISCIPLINE sure is key.",
  "i would look so cool carrying this around!",
  "wow 15!",
  "that's commendable and nice of them to do that.",
  "is there any WORK_OF_ART you are interested in despite not having seen it?",
  "i thought she'd be happy.",
  "this is just my PRODUCT.",
  "yeah that would be interesting to know.",
  "i love going to LOCATION.",
  "i've not known.",
  "i remember learning about that too.",
  "yup that is crazy!",
  "thank you for chatting as well.",
  "oh yeah true!",
  "oh yeah  i wouldn't down play it.",
  "yeah i bet they have to blame someone!",
  "and don't ever forget it.",
  "how nice!",
  "no. is it good?",
  "i'll have to look him up!",
  "i use PRODUCT regularly.",
  "well no he he....",
  "she can't answer you.",
  "he is quite rich.",
  "then why didn ’ t you talk to me?",
  "i don't think i have either.",
  "that'll be nonsmoking.",
  "yes, it's fully furnished.",
  "yeah those sure do.",
  "that is wild.",
  "it's a pretty good EVENT.",
  "i guess the MUSIC_GENRE could be different.",
  "i dont know too much about him.",
  "thats really cool.",
  "if i were you, i ’",
  "i don't think i've ever read any",
  "i do actually .",
  "that sounds rough.",
  "yeah i did hear about that i think its so wrong",
  "i have seen so many of those video's.",
  "it looks WORK_OF_ART",
  "i actually havent",
  "i know that we have sadly destroyed more than 80% of the LOCATION",
  "i do not want to get crossed over by ORG so i will pass.",
  "is there someone else i can talk to?",
  "he is just amazing.",
  "b-e-l-k-n-a-p.",
  "ok, let's move on!",
  "ah man.",
  "it ’ s beautiful but crowded.",
  "that's understandable.",
  "yes i completely agree with you.",
  "yes it's very fun.",
  "yep she sure did.",
  "yes she does .",
  "i did know that but i don't know why.",
  "no. which one was it?",
  "wow what do they do with all that deserted LOCATION?",
  "i wonder if that has something to do with it being owned by BUSINESS?",
  "i like ms PERSON more personally.",
  "that's how i do it too.",
  "no that is interesting.",
  "havent heard that one.",
  "extremely low.",
  "yep it's been fun.",
  "mr. PERSON had done very well for himself.",
  "i would have too then ha ha.",
  "wow he must have been good at that.",
  "why does he want to do that?",
  "im guessing you wear PRODUCT often?",
  "yes it is constantly changing.",
  "i have everything right here.",
  "i apologize, but i didn't realize that i did.",
  "wow that sounds like it would be kind of funny.",
  "3.00 yuan.",
  "yep i don't really know what he's worth.",
  "yes, i have some foreign PRODUCT to declare.",
  "i'll buy it if forty.",
  "i can't agree with you more!",
  "i think he did.",
  "run!",
  "i do not unless they go international.",
  "he also seems modest because he doesn't like to say that he was a WORK_OF_ART",
  "im way out there too.",
  "i like to go back a little further.",
  "very useful.",
  "glad they did now they are everywhere!",
  "that would be crazy fast.",
  "well, will you please put them down?",
  "i bet it's quite big!",
  "i think it was $50 PRODUCT?",
  "i did not know it was that long.",
  "oh wow that means it goes way back then.",
  "it is difficult to grasp.",
  "i don't think you are the only one.",
  "not sure what you mean by that.",
  "i will look it over for sure.",
  "you're very welcome!",
  "seems low to me.",
  "that seems incredibly sexist.",
  "was anyone else with him?",
  "no kidding!",
  "mr. : and over here is our LOCATION.",
  "yes and then seceded from the us.",
  "i don't know when i can come.",
  "i always wanted to visit LOCATION.",
  "it sounds like they are trying to do more than TYPE_OF_SPORT.",
  "i'm not sure i don't really follow NORP.",
  "go do what you have to do, but make sure it doesn't happen again.",
  "the ORG have historically done well though.",
  "your PRODUCT looks exactly the same.",
  "i could see why.",
  "i don't miss them either.",
  "no cant recall that PRODUCT.",
  "do you know why he started acting?",
  "hmm. doesn't sound very good.",
  "it was finally discontinued it in LOCATION in 2003.",
  "ok, we promise to do it well.",
  "i was wondering why myself.",
  "it looks like you only have $ 57 left in your PRODUCT.",
  "do you have any FOOD?",
  "i'd have to agree with you.",
  "you ’ ve got to be careful on the FOOD you eat.",
  "that is seriously bizarre but fascinating!",
  "i listen every now and then.",
  "i guess thats fair.",
  "no, it's LOCATION.",
  "ohh that's cool.",
  "and a WORK_OF_ART of them is actually immortal.",
  "wow sounds cool!",
  "that ’ s good to hear.",
  "oh, yes, it is.",
  "looks good.",
  "it doesn't even exist anymore so it can't even regret it",
  "i wonder if that's real?",
  "do i have to take them?",
  "i'm sure they're kicking themselves now!",
  "yes i do as well.",
  "i have heard that!",
  "i bet you know that because you're from mi.",
  "i guess they were pretty successful with selling them online.",
  "i should probably move to LOCATION.",
  "i think that is awesome.",
  "okay, i'll write it down for you.",
  "i think it should be casual.",
  "yeah im sure.",
  "goodness.",
  "hmm i have not idea who that would be.",
  "oh, it's so.",
  "we've very good at spreading out into new LOCATION.",
  "please hurry.",
  "as well at least you tried it.",
  "yeah i got confused by that always.",
  "oh that is cool.",
  "i think PERSON had.",
  "guess!",
  "that is eerie.",
  "i love streaming from my PRODUCT.",
  "that's neat",
  "that ’ s okay.",
  "she is multi-talented OCCUPATION.",
  "i never heard of that.",
  "july 20?",
  "it does seem pretty incredible!",
  "i'm not sure since i was busy pigging out.",
  "that is all right.",
  "i don't really dance.",
  "it is rather strange that he is the only one.",
  "that suprises me.",
  "that is incredible.",
  "oh i dont know.",
  "you are right, you've just missed the lunchtime EVENT.",
  "how many PRODUCT have you got with you?",
  "it is called a PRODUCT",
  "well, here you are.",
  "at 7:30 pm.",
  "that's a cool PRODUCT.",
  "i usually like his catchy MUSIC_GENRE but this was too much.",
  "i hope he retires after this EVENT.",
  "that is amazing",
  "probably on BUSINESS as well.",
  "they claim that it is PRODUCT-tuned.",
  "why use wooden PRODUCT?",
  "i work in a FAC too, but i i don ’ t mind it.",
  "let me examine you.",
  "LOCATION sounds good.",
  "we'll remain open from 9 a. m. till 8 p. m.",
  "i understand where they are coming from.",
  "thats a stupid LAW.",
  "oh like i said.",
  "did you play the PRODUCT.",
  "they never found it.",
  "only if you pay your LAW.",
  "he can speak LANGUAGE, too.",
  "i have seen ORG.",
  "would you ever travel around the LOCATION?",
  "i wonder where it is.",
  "is there anything else?",
  "that would be very scary!",
  "that is kind of hilarious.",
  "i wonder if that would be called a virtual PRODUCT.",
  "well. BUSINESS have come and gone.",
  "but very much quicker.",
  "i do not?",
  "i don't know if i ever read them.",
  "i ’ ll pay it as soon as possible.",
  "nice i do not think i have seen it.",
  "cant say that i have.",
  "oh ok interesting.",
  "i've heard that before!",
  "by osmosis!",
  "all right, expecting you.",
  "thats pretty much how it works for an BUSINESS qb.",
  "that is pretty good.",
  "i haven't seen those.",
  "no, i haven't got one by now.",
  "WORK_OF_ART is the best!",
  "unfortunately yes it is.",
  "oh, a WORK_OF_ART?",
  "you're probably correct.",
  "its been nice.",
  "it was catchy.",
  "you won ’ t see me here again.",
  "better than no PRODUCT at all.",
  "it won't start.",
  "just like most NATION.",
  "when i was younger.",
  "i know what you mean and it is sad to hear.",
  "they might have done just that.",
  "that would be 626-555-1739.",
  "i don't know but it make a good PRODUCT.",
  "from a sweet ma?!",
  "until 1998.",
  "ok, i'll try.",
  "what's he doing?",
  "yes, i ’ m serious.",
  "i think that the OCCUPATION had better see you.",
  "what would you like me to do?",
  "it was back in 1958.",
  "yeah i didnt know that.",
  "he is really dedicated to his WORK_OF_ART.",
  "is it still on?",
  "you want to go out with me and you know it.",
  "darling.",
  "i guess that is helpful.",
  "i admit that its true.",
  "you're always welcome.",
  "yeah so would i. i wouldn't mind visiting it.",
  "i ’ m sure that he will.",
  "dc stands for BUSINESS.",
  "it doesn;t like us.",
  "i did hear about the PRODUCT.",
  "i take it PRODUCT is the largest?",
  "that makes it worthwhile to attend such EVENT.",
  "it ’ s either $ 850 or nothing at all.",
  "oh, no, never.",
  "but they seemed to keep in it.",
  "are you new here?",
  "i always buy it online.",
  "it does to me as well but it's legal over there",
  "that ’ s the best that i can do.",
  "so you do not play much TYPE_OF_SPORT.",
  "they could have bought for 50 million.",
  "i think you will find it quiet.",
  "someone just robbed me.",
  "yes he seems very smart and also very ambitious.",
  "and they are so expensive.",
  "no!  i wonder if that's on PRODUCT?",
  "that does seem useful.",
  "yep and it's sad that his ORG who may have nothing to do with what he did suffers the most.",
  "i don't really watch the BUSINESS so i can't say i like it much.",
  "yeah that is neat.",
  "um... yes...",
  "that's great that they wanted to be so accurate.",
  "ya i don't know it could be.",
  "i hope not either.",
  "happy weekend to you too!",
  "it ’ s about PERSON.",
  "i did.",
  "i guess you can at that!",
  "it was a round EVENT for me.",
  "i stream too.",
  "they alWORK_OF_ARTs depicted it that WORK_OF_ART",
  "do you mind if i read your PRODUCT for a while?",
  "i actually completely agree with you.",
  "who is she?",
  "yes i think LOCATION are important.",
  "you don't know where you want to look for one?",
  "wow they are ancient for sure.",
  "it is a little shocking.",
  "usually WORK_OF_ART.",
  "i have travelled some.",
  "i like BUSINESS.",
  "neither did i.",
  "that sounds pretty cool.",
  "no, i have never vacationed anywhere exotic.",
  "you don't say.",
  "everyone is doing great.",
  "that's interesting too.",
  "several.",
  "i do envy you.",
  "that would be hard to pull off on PRODUCT.",
  "yeah i can see that actually.",
  "because it's better, easier and cheaper to get them from the FOOD we eat.",
  "i feel miserable.",
  "i do like some of her PRODUCT.",
  "uh huh...",
  "what is a WORK_OF_ART?",
  "at least $300 i heard.",
  "BUSINESS...",
  "he was not?",
  "i guess we should get there no later than 7:00.",
  "i would say there is for sure!",
  "i would love to travel around the LOCATION.",
  "no. hate them.",
  "yeah that is pretty strange",
  "i'm surprised to still hear that.",
  "would you like these PRODUCT delivered or would you like to pick them up?",
  "lols.",
  "the qb is PERSON.",
  "i agree that is how it looks.",
  "it's about 5 LOCATION.",
  "i have some cold PRODUCT if you would like one.",
  "i'm absolutely sure that this is what i want.",
  "yeah that is an odd EVENT to implement it i suppose",
  "it is pretty weird.",
  "that would really be crazy.",
  "it is impressive that is for sure.",
  "yes, i like using PRODUCT.",
  "i had not heard that.",
  "i have played.",
  "no.  i havent.",
  "but i...",
  "i'm honored to know you.",
  "don ’ t do it!",
  "oh. good for him!",
  "all right, those sound good.",
  "he's a great qb.",
  "when will he come back, do you know?",
  "how am i going to get home?",
  "i don't watch tv much.",
  "thats a very good one.",
  "have you heard of the FAC?",
  "that's where i'm at.",
  "ok, someone will be there by 12:15.",
  "was it good?",
  "you can say that again!",
  "i have not seen any of them.",
  "that would be amazing to see.!",
  "i wish they would still do that.",
  "that certainly isn't something PERSON would've done!",
  "no thats interesting too.",
  "i havnt checked that out yet.",
  "that actually sounds cool.",
  "i hope they did well on the re-make.",
  "as long as the PRODUCT on my macchiato's not burnt, too, i'll be alright for a while.",
  "i do enjoy going to live EVENT but don't go as often as i would like.",
  "it did.",
  "i mostly use BUSINESS.",
  "yes and if they get stuck together there is no separating them",
  "i never saw that one.",
  "i wonder how that went lol.",
  "you would think so with all the FOOD they would ingest!",
  "agreed there.",
  "i don't mind that.",
  "that makes it pretty cool!!",
  "he towered over her during the EVENT.",
  "i remember hearing about that.",
  "so what do you provide?",
  "perhaps i'd better ring the ORG...",
  "oh, yes that would be nice.",
  "NORP.",
  "i love that about her.",
  "probably -- i don't know.",
  "it was alright.",
  "yeah i thought like you as well.",
  "not really they are really long and painful to read as they are small",
  "interesting i'll have to look into it!",
  "but you haven't practised all that much.",
  "yeah  i didnt realize its so recent either.",
  "yes, but i threw them back.",
  "it's quite a long WORK_OF_ART.",
  "wow i wonder how that works actually.",
  "i didn't know that and that's very interesting.",
  "there's nothing i can do about that.",
  "i think it's called FOOD?",
  "i was pulling for LOCATION as well.",
  "well, i don't think it's the best PRODUCT for me.",
  "well, as i was saying, they showed each other what they had decided to bring.",
  "yes well it is definitely different than TYPE_OF_SPORT!",
  "it was good talking with you!",
  "who ’ s that?",
  "is a 100% PRODUCT good or bad though?",
  "sorry, you're right.",
  "i used to fun",
  "yes, we will.",
  "indeed he could!",
  "you can stay if you catch up and stay caught up.",
  "i really enjoy TYPE_OF_SPORT!",
  "would you like some more?",
  "PRODUCT is my favourite.",
  "no, just a small one.",
  "that i will agree with.",
  "save a life!",
  "could you tell me where the dishwashing PRODUCT is?",
  "do you like surfing?",
  "he is funny in that one.",
  "i've always wanted to go there.",
  "yeah that's weird.",
  "and i wonder how they measure that!",
  "i don't know what it is called.",
  "not that i was ever likely to go to LOCATION.",
  "barker?",
  "i am hooked on amazon shopping!",
  "i did not know before but it cool to know.",
  "i think that is pretty cool.",
  "what can they do?",
  "i agree and i didn't know that.",
  "i don't care for FOOD.",
  "thank you for repairing it.",
  "yeah because they rewrote it verbatim so it was bound to fail",
  "hilarious!",
  "some of them might.",
  "...and who is he ?",
  "i wouldn't want to come across those for sure.",
  "it ’ s ok.where should i pay for the LAW?",
  "very honorable of them.",
  "i think i sometimes try to be over-organized.",
  "in my PRODUCT.",
  "let's go shopping.",
  "like. say.",
  "yea korean pop!",
  "why did you drag me into this?",
  "i will PRODUCT it soon!",
  "by striking it?",
  "it is sad.",
  "like i said.",
  "i am not exactly sure but sounds familiar.",
  "then let's stay in a BUSINESS.",
  "it just seems so invasive.",
  "i have no idea.good point.",
  "i just can't decide where to go.",
  "i meant that they're very simple, easy to talk to.",
  "that is really scary.",
  "next saturday at the earliest.",
  "that is too bad.",
  "are they going to stay here with us?",
  "but are the public LOCATION good everywhere?",
  "then how about the FOOD?",
  "and yet they still manage.",
  "are you watching BUSINESS?",
  "thats funny if you think about it.",
  "that is ironic.",
  "not too sure.",
  "i don't mind helping.",
  "no what happened with them?",
  "you know, i really must be going now",
  "i didn't that.",
  "i bet they really worked at it before 1805.",
  "does it come with a PRODUCT?",
  "im not sure about that",
  "yea lol.",
  "well, would you like to go?",
  "that would be kinda cool!",
  "i should be done by friday.",
  "yeah back then it was respectable.",
  "he must be really smart.",
  "ok, what is this?",
  "i think i ’ d like to just get another PRODUCT, please.",
  "i would agree with you!",
  "i would love to listen to those.",
  "yes, but you have to pay for it.",
  "i do like BUSINESS.",
  "yes he's a qb.",
  "that is very scary.",
  "i don't think we have anything to worry about.",
  "it's been around so long.",
  "i agree that has to be changed.",
  "yeah. .\"",
  "thats something i would not want to see.",
  "that sounds cool i should actually do that.",
  "listen, i know who you are.",
  "it is so convenient especially for the ORG",
  "i wonder if that means anything else though in their LANGUAGE.",
  "i want to trust PERSON on this.",
  "wow that would improve it for sure.",
  "yes!",
  "cute!",
  "let me check that for you right now.",
  "i like those ORG.",
  "he was happy and proud he scored 40.",
  "that sounds just right to me.",
  "that is pretty cool of them.",
  "how long do you think it will take to get to FAC.",
  "he did indeed.",
  "yes, there's one here.",
  "i think that it is around 600.",
  "yes, look over there.",
  "it was PERSON that created it.",
  "i have never faked a WORK_OF_ART.",
  "would i get to wear a cool PRODUCT?",
  "yes and they never started him .",
  "i find that sad.",
  "can you describe their FOOD?",
  "that ’ s amazing.",
  "we can do that if you like.",
  "i agree on that as well.",
  "i think that's so ridiculous.",
  "PERSON patented his though.",
  "ya i would rather listen to PRODUCT",
  "and he is not in it at all?",
  "ok, i will go there myself.",
  "i bet he does!",
  "i thought it was odd.",
  "it was lovely speaking with you!",
  "oh that was short for sure.",
  "yes, there is.",
  "it may be why they are a dying BUSINESS unable to rebrand themselves.",
  "i'll show you how.",
  "are you laughing at me?",
  "that would have been funny.",
  "i just read about it but have never heard of it before now.",
  "so where did you land?",
  "i will tell you what i can agree to.",
  "i guess a WORK_OF_ART was needed.",
  "no cant say that i have.",
  "oh, we are skillful in doing that.",
  "it ’ s that popular?",
  "i am too far gone to change now.",
  "do you want anything else?",
  "where did you learn it?",
  "what was that about?",
  "i don't watch that either.",
  "its amazing.",
  "me too.",
  "yeah she was really good as well.",
  "i will support myself.",
  "yeah i'm not sure either.",
  "that would be strange.",
  "some ANIMAL just should be domesticated.",
  "it really shows how valuable.",
  "that would have been cute.",
  "no, but it's painful.",
  "i dont know either.",
  "that is very kind of you.",
  "i don't understand it.",
  "when i first heard that.",
  "i will have to look for that.",
  "alright, see you.",
  "it would at that!",
  "so then why would you ask them out in the first LOCATION?",
  "i was wondering the exact same!",
  "i know they were hugely popular.",
  "that would have something to see.",
  "we need to find a good BUSINESS.",
  "i think he had to be really skinny :)",
  "uh huh, that's for sure.",
  "i ’ m an it OCCUPATION.",
  "i find her WORK_OF_ART to charitable giving something to aspire to.",
  "that's very good.",
  "i wonder what the WORK_OF_ART is with doing that?",
  "that's very commendable of LOCATION to do that.",
  "she is awesome",
  "he sure does.",
  "i hope he didn't buy something embarrassing!",
  "all right, i see what you mean.",
  "yeah that would be pretty wild.",
  "only though the PRODUCT?",
  "i would have never guessed that!",
  "it's too complicated.",
  "most of them live in the LOCATION.",
  "that's pretty much what i heard.",
  "err, well, i can ’ t decide right now.",
  "yes you have to be careful.",
  "not really i like everything.",
  "just throw FOOD.",
  "that is just so sad.",
  "yeah which is unfortunate.",
  "i think he was a smart OCCUPATION.",
  "until he retires.",
  "i have not seen it.",
  "i guess not...",
  "yeah as long as they qualify.",
  "i think they're starting to incorporate them.",
  "i graduated and i'am working towards my next LAW.",
  "it was invented by PERSON.",
  "the NATION did quite well.",
  "they are short, i guess.",
  "i never watched it.",
  "especially the SPORTS_EVENT!",
  "oh very cool.",
  "how much do you want to deposit?",
  "i think we all are!",
  "i have told you that i don ’ t need them any more.",
  "maybe if i understood LANGUAGE.",
  "should i just trim it?",
  "the PRODUCT game?",
  "that was very nice of them to do that.",
  "it's pc PRODUCT...",
  "i'm much better.",
  "wonder if they're any good.",
  "i guess i'd buy that...",
  "i didn't really have to figure it out.",
  "that's good for him.",
  "i'll find it...",
  "apparently he was.",
  "i am not big into the \"fiddle\" MUSIC_GENRE myself",
  "i bet i could guess.",
  "yeah because he really likes WORK_OF_ART too",
  "i would not want to go there.",
  "ok, you're through now.",
  "is that right.wow.",
  "are you really interested in doing something?",
  "yeah it was sadly",
  "i didn't know that but that is very interesting.",
  "yes, that's what i plan to do.",
  "i wonder if he was in a ORG?",
  "so get prepared for everything.",
  "yes i play the PRODUCT actually.",
  "like growing FOOD!",
  "i'm curious about that.",
  "yeah i had not idea about that either.",
  "i doubt so.",
  "1955.",
